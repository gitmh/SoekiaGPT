        "text": "THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES \n\nMany years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, “he is sitting in council,” it was always said of him, “The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe.”\nTime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.\n“These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!” thought the Emperor. “Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.” And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.\nSo the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.\n“I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,” said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.\n“I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,” said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, “he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.”\nSo the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms. “What can be the meaning of this?” thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. “I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.” However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.\nThe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. “What!” thought he again. “Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.”\n“Well, Sir Minister!” said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.\n“You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.”\n“Oh, it is excellent!” replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. “This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.”\n“We shall be much obliged to you,” said the impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms.\nThe Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.\n“Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?” asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors which were not there.\n“I certainly am not stupid!” thought the messenger. “It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one shall know anything about it.” And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. “Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,” said he to his sovereign when he returned, “the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.”\nThe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense.\nAnd now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.\n“Is not the work absolutely magnificent?” said the two officers of the crown, already mentioned. “If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!” and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.\n“How is this?” said the Emperor to himself. “I can see nothing! This is indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen Oh! the cloth is charming,” said he, aloud. “It has my complete approbation.” And he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, “Oh, how beautiful!”\n and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. “Magnificent! Charming!\nExcellent!” resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of “Gentlemen Weavers.”\nThe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.\n“See!” cried they, at last. “The Emperor's new clothes are ready!”\nAnd now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, “Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.”\n“Yes indeed!” said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see anything of this exquisite manufacture.\n“If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.”\nThe Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side, before the looking glass.\n“How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they fit!” everyone cried out. “What a design! What colors! These are indeed royal robes!”\n“The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession, is waiting,” announced the chief master of the ceremonies.\n“I am quite ready,” answered the Emperor. “Do my new clothes fit well?”\n asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.\nThe lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle; and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.\nSo now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!” in short, no one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.\n“But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.\n“Listen to the voice of innocence!” exclaimed his father; and what the child had said was whispered from one to another.\n“But he has nothing at all on!” at last cried out all the people.\nThe Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in reality, there was no train to hold."

        "text": "THE SWINEHERD \n\nThere was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to marry.\nIt was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter, “Will you have me?” But so he did; for his name was renowned far and wide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered, “Yes!” and “Thank you kindly.” We shall see what this princess said.\nListen!\nIt happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose tree a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose!\nIt smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who inhaled its fragrance.\nAnd furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and they were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.\nThe Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was playing at “Visiting,” with the ladies of the court; and when she saw the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.\n“Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!” said she; but the rose tree, with its beautiful rose came to view.\n“Oh, how prettily it is made!” said all the court ladies.\n“It is more than pretty,” said the Emperor, “it is charming!”\nBut the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.\n“Fie, papa!” said she. “It is not made at all, it is natural!”\n“Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad humor,” said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so delightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.\n“Superbe! Charmant!” exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter French, each one worse than her neighbor.\n“How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our blessed Empress,” said an old knight. “Oh yes! These are the same tones, the same execution.”\n“Yes! yes!” said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the remembrance.\n“I will still hope that it is not a real bird,” said the Princess.\n“Yes, it is a real bird,” said those who had brought it. “Well then let the bird fly,” said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the Prince.\nHowever, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.\n“Good day to my lord, the Emperor!” said he. “Can I have employment at the palace?”\n“Why, yes,” said the Emperor. “I want some one to take care of the pigs, for we have a great many of them.”\nSo the Prince was appointed “Imperial Swineherd.” He had a dirty little room close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in the most charming manner, and played the old melody, \n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,     Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”*\n    * “Ah! dear Augustine!\n    All is gone, gone, gone!”\nBut what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of the kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on every hearth in the city this, you see, was something quite different from the rose.\nNow the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune, she stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play “Lieber Augustine”; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one finger.\n“Why there is my piece,” said the Princess. “That swineherd must certainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument.”\nSo one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden slippers first.\n“What will you take for the kitchen-pot?” said the lady.\n“I will have ten kisses from the Princess,” said the swineherd.\n“Yes, indeed!” said the lady.\n“I cannot sell it for less,” rejoined the swineherd.\n“He is an impudent fellow!” said the Princess, and she walked on; but when she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily \n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,     Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”\n“Stay,” said the Princess. “Ask him if he will have ten kisses from the ladies of my court.”\n“No, thank you!” said the swineherd. “Ten kisses from the Princess, or I keep the kitchen-pot myself.”\n“That must not be, either!” said the Princess. “But do you all stand before me that no one may see us.”\nAnd the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread out their dresses the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess the kitchen-pot.\nThat was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the whole of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at every fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's; the court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.\n“We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has cutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!”\n“Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.”\nThe swineherd that is to say the Prince, for no one knew that he was other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working at something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard since the creation of the world.\n“Ah, that is superbe!” said the Princess when she passed by. “I have never heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!”\n“He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!” said the lady who had been to ask.\n“I think he is not in his right senses!” said the Princess, and walked on, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. “One must encourage art,” said she, “I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he shall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest from the ladies of the court.”\n“Oh but we should not like that at all!” said they. “What are you muttering?” asked the Princess. “If I can kiss him, surely you can.\nRemember that you owe everything to me.” So the ladies were obliged to go to him again.\n“A hundred kisses from the Princess,” said he, “or else let everyone keep his own!”\n“Stand round!” said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the kissing was going on.\n“What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?” said the Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed his eyes, and put on his spectacles. “They are the ladies of the court; I must go down and see what they are about!” So he pulled up his slippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.\nAs soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might go on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his tiptoes.\n“What is all this?” said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss.\n“March out!” said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess and swineherd were thrust out of the city.\nThe Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain poured down.\n“Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!” said the Princess. “If I had but married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!”\nAnd the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his princely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help bowing before him.\n“I am come to despise thee,” said he. “Thou would'st not have an honorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale, but thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery plaything. Thou art rightly served.”\nHe then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his palace in her face. Now she might well sing, \n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,     Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”"

        "text": "THE REAL PRINCESS \n\nThere was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she must be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible for him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite cast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his wife.\nOne evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the rain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as pitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and the old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.\nIt was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain and the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from her hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real Princess.\n“Ah! we shall soon see that!” thought the old Queen-mother; however, she said not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the bedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas on the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over the three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.\nUpon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.\nThe next morning she was asked how she had slept. “Oh, very badly indeed!” she replied. “I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night through. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard under me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!”\nNow it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had been able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a delicate sense of feeling.\nThe Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he had found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the cabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they are not lost.\nWasn't this a lady of real delicacy?"

        "text": "RUMPELSTILTZKIN \n\nThere was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful daughter. Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. “Now that’s a talent worth having,” said the King to the miller; “if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I’ll put her to the test.” When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: “Now set to work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven’t spun the straw into gold you shall die.” Then he closed the door behind him and left her alone inside.\nSo the poor miller’s daughter sat down, and didn’t know what in the world she was to do. She hadn’t the least idea of how to spin straw into gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry.\nSuddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said:\n“Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?” “Oh!”\n answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and haven’t a notion how it’s done.” “What will you give me if I spin it for you?” asked the manikin. “My necklace,” replied the girl. The little man took the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the bobbin was full. Then he put on another, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal. He had the miller’s daughter put into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all into gold before the following morning. The girl didn’t know what to do, and began to cry; then the door opened as before, and the tiny little man appeared and said: “What’ll you give me if I spin the straw into gold for you?” “The ring from my finger,” answered the girl. The manikin took the ring, and whir! round went the spinning-wheel again, and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold.\nThe King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold was still not satisfied, and he had the miller’s daughter brought into a yet bigger room full of straw, and said: “You must spin all this away in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.”\n “She’s only a miller’s daughter, it’s true,” he thought; “but I couldn’t find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.” When the girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said:\n“What’ll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?” “I’ve nothing more to give,” answered the girl. “Then promise me when you are Queen to give me your first child.” “Who knows what may not happen before that?” thought the miller’s daughter; and besides, she saw no other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold. When the King came in the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he straightway made her his wife, and the miller’s daughter became a queen.\nWhen a year had passed a beautiful son was born to her, and she thought no more of the little man, till all of a sudden one day he stepped into her room and said: “Now give me what you promised.” The Queen was in a great state, and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if he would only leave her the child. But the manikin said: “No, a living creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.” Then the Queen began to cry and sob so bitterly that the little man was sorry for her, and said: “I’ll give you three days to guess my name, and if you find it out in that time you may keep your child.”\nThen the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to pick up far and near any names he could come across. When the little man arrived on the following day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and all the other names she knew, in a string, but at each one the manikin called out: “That’s not my name.” The next day she sent to inquire the names of all the people in the neighborhood, and had a long list of the most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made his appearance. “Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks, Spindleshanks?” but he always replied: “That’s not my name.” On the third day the messenger returned and announced: “I have not been able to find any new names, but as I came upon a high hill round the corner of the wood, where the foxes and hares bid each other good-night, I saw a little house, and in front of the house burned a fire, and round the fire sprang the most grotesque little man, hopping on one leg and crying:\n  “To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake,     And then the child away I’ll take;     For little deems my royal dame     That Rumpelstiltzkin is my name!”\nYou can imagine the Queen’s delight at hearing the name, and when the little man stepped in shortly afterward and asked: “Now, my lady Queen, what’s my name?” she asked first: “Is your name Conrad?” “No.” “Is your name Harry?” “No.” “Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?” “Some demon has told you that! some demon has told you that!” screamed the little man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two."

        "text": "PUSS IN BOOTS \n\nThere was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than his mill, his ass, and his cat. The partition was soon made. Neither scrivener nor attorney was sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony. The eldest had the mill, the second the ass, and the youngest nothing but the cat. The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.\n“My brothers,” said he, “may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.”\nThe Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:\n“Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master. You have nothing else to do but to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine.”\nThe Cat’s master did not build very much upon what he said. He had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition. When the Cat had what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.\nScarce was he lain down but he had what he wanted. A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty.\nHe was shown upstairs into the King’s apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:\n“I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren, which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas” (for that was the title which puss was pleased to give his master) “has commanded me to present to your majesty from him.”\n“Tell thy master,” said the king, “that I thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.”\nAnother time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew the strings and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.\nThe Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master’s taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that he was to take the air along the river-side, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master:\n“If you will follow my advice your fortune is made. You have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.”\nThe Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore. While he was washing the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out:\n“Help! help! My Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to be drowned.”\nAt this noise the King put his head out of the coach-window, and, finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his Lordship the Marquis of Carabas. While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that, while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, though he had cried out: “Thieves! thieves!”\n several times, as loud as he could.\nThis cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.\nThe King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made and very handsome in his person), the King’s daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:\n“Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.”\nThe King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.\n“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” answered they altogether, for the Cat’s threats had made them terribly afraid.\n“You see, sir,” said the Marquis, “this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.”\nThe Master Cat, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:\n“Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.”\nThe King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong.\n“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” replied the reapers, and the King was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon. The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met, and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.\nMonsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him.\nThe ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit down.\n“I have been assured,” said the Cat, “that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.”\n“That is true,” answered the ogre very briskly; “and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.”\nPuss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.\n“I have been, moreover, informed,” said the Cat, “but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you I take this to be impossible.”\n“Impossible!” cried the ogre; “you shall see that presently.”\nAnd at the same time he changed himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up.\nMeanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the ogre’s, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty’s coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the King:\n“Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.”\n“What! my Lord Marquis,” cried the King, “and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.”\nThe Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with him, and, seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses:\n“It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.”\nThe Marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honor which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.\nPuss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more but only for his diversion."

        "text": "FELICIA AND THE POT OF PINKS \n\nOnce upon a time there was a poor laborer who, feeling that he had not much longer to live, wished to divide his possessions between his son and daughter, whom he loved dearly.\nSo he called them to him, and said: “Your mother brought me as her dowry two stools and a straw bed; I have, besides, a hen, a pot of pinks, and a silver ring, which were given me by a noble lady who once lodged in my poor cottage. When she went away she said to me:\n“‘Be careful of my gifts, good man; see that you do not lose the ring or forget to water the pinks. As for your daughter, I promise you that she shall be more beautiful than anyone you ever saw in your life; call her Felicia, and when she grows up give her the ring and the pot of pinks to console her for her poverty.’ Take them both, then, my dear child,” he added, “and your brother shall have everything else.”\nThe two children seemed quite contented, and when their father died they wept for him, and divided his possessions as he had told them. Felicia believed that her brother loved her, but when she sat down upon one of the stools he said angrily:\n“Keep your pot of pinks and your ring, but let my things alone. I like order in my house.”\nFelicia, who was very gentle, said nothing, but stood up crying quietly; while Bruno, for that was her brother’s name, sat comfortably by the fire. Presently, when supper-time came, Bruno had a delicious egg, and he threw the shell to Felicia, saying:\n“There, that is all I can give you; if you don’t like it, go out and catch frogs; there are plenty of them in the marsh close by.” Felicia did not answer, but she cried more bitterly than ever, and went away to her own little room. She found it filled with the sweet scent of the pinks, and, going up to them, she said sadly:\n“Beautiful pinks, you are so sweet and so pretty, you are the only comfort I have left. Be very sure that I will take care of you, and water you well, and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your stems.”\nAs she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry. So taking her pitcher, she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain, which was at some distance. When she reached it she sat down upon the brink to rest, but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming toward her, surrounded by numbers of attendants. Six maids of honor carried her train, and she leaned upon the arm of another.\nWhen they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her, under which was placed a sofa of cloth-of-gold, and presently a dainty supper was served, upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal, while the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the softest music.\nFelicia was hidden in the shade, too much astonished by all she saw to venture to move; but in a few moments the Queen said:\n“I fancy I see a shepherdess near that tree; bid her come hither.”\nSo Felicia came forward and saluted the Queen timidly, but with so much grace that all were surprised.\n“What are you doing here, my pretty child?” asked the Queen. “Are you not afraid of robbers?”\n“Ah! madam,” said Felicia, “a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose does not fear robbers.”\n“You are not very rich, then?” said the Queen, smiling.\n“I am so poor,” answered Felicia, “that a pot of pinks and a silver ring are my only possessions in the world.”\n“But you have a heart,” said the Queen. “What should you say if anybody wanted to steal that?”\n“I do not know what it is like to lose one’s heart, madam,” she replied; “but I have always heard that without a heart one cannot live, and if it is broken one must die; and in spite of my poverty I should be sorry not to live.”\n“You are quite right to take care of your heart, pretty one,” said the Queen. “But tell me, have you supped?”\n“No, madam,” answered Felicia; “my brother ate all the supper there was.”\nThen the Queen ordered that a place should be made for her at the table, and herself loaded Felicia’s plate with good things; but she was too much astonished to be hungry.\n“I want to know what you were doing at the fountain so late?” said the Queen presently.\n“I came to fetch a pitcher of water for my pinks, madam,” she answered, stooping to pick up the pitcher which stood beside her; but when she showed it to the Queen she was amazed to see that it had turned to gold, all sparkling with great diamonds, and the water, of which it was full, was more fragrant than the sweetest roses. She was afraid to take it until the Queen said:\n“It is yours, Felicia; go and water your pinks with it, and let it remind you that the Queen of the Woods is your friend.”\nThe shepherdess threw herself at the Queen’s feet, and thanked her humbly for her gracious words.\n“Ah! madam,” she cried, “if I might beg you to stay here a moment I would run and fetch my pot of pinks for you they could not fall into better hands.”\n“Go, Felicia,” said the Queen, stroking her cheek softly; “I will wait here until you come back.”\nSo Felicia took up her pitcher and ran to her little room, but while she had been away Bruno had gone in and taken the pot of pinks, leaving a great cabbage in its place. When she saw the unlucky cabbage Felicia was much distressed, and did not know what to do; but at last she ran back to the fountain, and, kneeling before the Queen, said:\n“Madam, Bruno has stolen my pot of pinks, so I have nothing but my silver ring; but I beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude.”\n“But if I take your ring, my pretty shepherdess,” said the Queen, “you will have nothing left; and what will you do then?”\n“Ah! madam,” she answered simply, “if I have your friendship I shall do very well.”\nSo the Queen took the ring and put it on her finger, and mounted her chariot, which was made of coral studded with emeralds, and drawn by six milk-white horses. And Felicia looked after her until the winding of the forest path hid her from her sight, and then she went back to the cottage, thinking over all the wonderful things that had happened.\nThe first thing she did when she reached her room was to throw the cabbage out of the window.\nBut she was very much surprised to hear an odd little voice cry out:\n“Oh! I am half killed!” and could not tell where it came from, because cabbages do not generally speak.\nAs soon as it was light, Felicia, who was very unhappy about her pot of pinks, went out to look for it, and the first thing she found was the unfortunate cabbage. She gave it a push with her foot, saying: “What are you doing here, and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of pinks?”\n“If I hadn’t been carried,” replied the cabbage, “you may be very sure that I shouldn’t have thought of going there.”\nIt made her shiver with fright to hear the cabbage talk, but he went on:\n“If you will be good enough to plant me by my comrades again, I can tell you where your pinks are at this moment hidden in Bruno’s bed!”\nFelicia was in despair when she heard this, not knowing how she was to get them back. But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old place, and, as she finished doing it, she saw Bruno’s hen, and said, catching hold of it:\n“Come here, horrid little creature! you shall suffer for all the unkind things my brother has done to me.”\n“Ah! shepherdess,” said the hen, “don’t kill me; I am rather a gossip, and I can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear.\nDon’t imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought you up; your mother was a queen who had six girls already, and the King threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she should have her head cut off.\n“So when the Queen had another little daughter she was quite frightened, and agreed with her sister (who was a fairy) to exchange her for the fairy’s little son. Now the Queen had been shut up in a great tower by the King’s orders, and when a great many days went by and still she heard nothing from the Fairy she made her escape from the window by means of a rope ladder, taking her little baby with her. After wandering about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this cottage. I was the laborer’s wife, and was a good nurse, and the Queen gave you into my charge, and told me all her misfortunes, and then died before she had time to say what was to become of you.\n“As I never in all my life could keep a secret, I could not help telling this strange tale to my neighbors, and one day a beautiful lady came here, and I told it to her also. When I had finished she touched me with a wand she held in her hand, and instantly I became a hen, and there was an end of my talking! I was very sad, and my husband, who was out when it happened, never knew what had become of me. After seeking me everywhere he believed that I must have been drowned, or eaten up by wild beasts in the forest. That same lady came here once more, and commanded that you should be called Felicia, and left the ring and the pot of pinks to be given to you; and while she was in the house twenty-five of the King’s guards came to search for you, doubtless meaning to kill you; but she muttered a few words, and immediately they all turned into cabbages. It was one of them whom you threw out of your window yesterday.\n“I don’t know how it was that he could speak I have never heard either of them say a word before, nor have I been able to do it myself until now.”\nThe Princess was greatly astonished at the hen’s story, and said kindly:\n“I am truly sorry for you, my poor nurse, and wish it was in my power to restore you to your real form. But we must not despair; it seems to me, after what you have told me, that something must be going to happen soon. Just now, however, I must go and look for my pinks, which I love better than anything in the world.”\nBruno had gone out into the forest, never thinking that Felicia would search in his room for the pinks, and she was delighted by his unexpected absence, and thought to get them back without further trouble. But as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army of rats, who were guarding the straw bed; and when she attempted to approach it they sprang at her, biting and scratching furiously. Quite terrified, she drew back, crying out: “Oh! my dear pinks, how can you stay here in such bad company?”\nThen she suddenly bethought herself of the pitcher of water, and, hoping that it might have some magic power, she ran to fetch it, and sprinkled a few drops over the fierce-looking swarm of rats. In a moment not a tail or a whisker was to be seen. Each one had made for his hole as fast as his legs could carry him, so that the Princess could safely take her pot of pinks. She found them nearly dying for want of water, and hastily poured all that was left in the pitcher upon them. As she bent over them, enjoying their delicious scent, a soft voice, that seemed to rustle among the leaves, said:\n“Lovely Felicia, the day has come at last when I may have the happiness of telling you how even the flowers love you and rejoice in your beauty.”\nThe Princess, quite overcome by the strangeness of hearing a cabbage, a hen, and a pink speak, and by the terrible sight of an army of rats, suddenly became very pale, and fainted away.\nAt this moment in came Bruno. Working hard in the heat had not improved his temper, and when he saw that Felicia had succeeded in finding her pinks he was so angry that he dragged her out into the garden and shut the door upon her. The fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes, and there before her stood the Queen of the Woods, looking as charming as ever.\n“You have a bad brother,” she said; “I saw he turned you out. Shall I punish him for it?”\n“Ah! no, madam,” she said; “I am not angry with him.\n“But supposing he was not your brother, after all, what would you say then?” asked the Queen.\n“Oh! but I think he must be,” said Felicia.\n“What!” said the Queen, “have you not heard that you are a Princess?”\n“I was told so a little while ago, madam, but how could I believe it without a single proof?”\n“Ah! dear child,” said the Queen, “the way you speak assures me that, in spite of your humble upbringing, you are indeed a real princess, and I can save you from being treated in such a way again.”\nShe was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome young man. He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps, and had a crown of pinks on his head. He knelt upon one knee and kissed the Queen’s hand.\n“Ah!” she cried, “my pink, my dear son, what a happiness to see you restored to your natural shape by Felicia’s aid!” And she embraced him joyfully. Then, turning to Felicia, she said:\n“Charming Princess, I know all the hen told you, but you cannot have heard that the zephyrs, to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my son to the tower where the Queen, your mother, so anxiously waited for him, left him instead in a garden of flowers, while they flew off to tell your mother. Whereupon a fairy with whom I had quarrelled changed him into a pink, and I could do nothing to prevent it.\n“You can imagine how angry I was, and how I tried to find some means of undoing the mischief she had done; but there was no help for it. I could only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up, hoping that when you grew up he might love you, and by your care be restored to his natural form. And you see everything has come right, as I hoped it would. Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the power of the charm was nearly over, and my enemy’s last chance was to frighten you with her army of rats. That she did not succeed in doing; so now, my dear Felicia, if you will be married to my son with this silver ring your future happiness is certain. Do you think him handsome and amiable enough to be willing to marry him?”\n“Madam,” replied Felicia, blushing, “you overwhelm me with your kindness. I know that you are my mother’s sister, and that by your art you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages, and my nurse into a hen, and that you do me only too much honor in proposing that I shall marry your son. How can I explain to you the cause of my hesitation? I feel, for the first time in my life, how happy it would make me to be beloved. Can you indeed give me the Prince’s heart?”\n“It is yours already, lovely Princess!” he cried, taking her hand in his; “but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent I should have told you long ago how dearly I love you.”\nThis made the Princess very happy, and the Queen, who could not bear to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess, touched her with her wand, saying:\n“I wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty.” And immediately the Princess’s cotton dress became a magnificent robe of silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles, and her soft dark hair was encircled by a crown of diamonds, from which floated a clear white veil.\nWith her bright eyes, and the charming color in her cheeks, she was altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it.\n“How pretty you are, Felicia!” he cried. “Don’t keep me in suspense, I entreat you; say that you will marry me.”\n“Ah!” said the Queen, smiling, “I think she will not refuse now.”\nJust then Bruno, who was going back to his work, came out of the cottage, and thought he must be dreaming when he saw Felicia; but she called him very kindly, and begged the Queen to take pity on him.\n“What!” she said, “when he was so unkind to you?”\n“Ah! madam,” said the Princess, “I am so happy that I should like everybody else to be happy too.”\nThe Queen kissed her, and said: “Well, to please you, let me see what I can do for this cross Bruno.” And with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid palace, full of treasures; only the two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were, to remind him of his former poverty. Then the Queen touched Bruno himself, and made him gentle and polite and grateful, and he thanked her and the Princess a thousand times. Lastly, the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms, and left them all very contented. The Prince and Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor, and lived happily ever after."

        "text": "THE FORTY THIEVES \n\nIn a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers, one named Cassim, the other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty, while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a neighboring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes, and said: “Open, Sesame!”(1) so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened again, and the Forty Thieves came out. As the Captain went in last he came out first, and made them all pass by him; he then closed the door, saying: “Shut, Sesame!” Every man bridled his horse and mounted, the Captain put himself at their head, and they returned as they came.\n(1) Sesame is a kind of grain.\nThen Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said: “Open, Sesame!” and it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich bales of merchandise silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots.\nUsing the words: “Shut, Sesame!” he closed the door and went home.\nThen he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade her keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. “Let me first measure it,” said his wife. “I will go borrow a measure of someone, while you dig the hole.” So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali Baba’s poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba’s wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it back to her sister, without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim’s wife perceived directly her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim when he came home: “Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does not count his money, he measures it.” He begged her to explain this riddle, which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. “Ali Baba,” he said, showing him the gold piece, “you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold.” By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife’s folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. “That I expect,” said Cassim; “but I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all.” Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door in the rock. He said: “Open, Sesame!” and the door opened and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of “Sesame,” he said: “Open, Barley!” and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if he had never heard it.\nAbout noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim’s mules roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the alarm; they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their Captain’s saying: “Open, Sesame!” Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their horses’ feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their secret. They cut Cassim’s body into four quarters, and nailed them up inside the cave, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure.\nAs night drew on Cassim’s wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim.\nThe first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassim’s house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her: “This is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now tell your mistress I am come.” The wife of Cassim, on learning the fate of her husband, broke out into cries and tears, but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and dried her eyes.\nMorgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges. “My poor master,” she said, “can neither eat nor speak, and no one knows what his distemper is.” She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die. Thus, in the evening, no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim’s wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was dead. The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a piece of gold in his hand, and bade him follow her with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim’s wife stayed at home uttering lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba, who gave Cassim’s shop to his eldest son.\nThe Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to find Cassim’s body gone and some of their money-bags. “We are certainly discovered,” said the Captain, “and shall be undone if we cannot find out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed.” One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha’s stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: “Honest man, how can you possibly see to stitch at your age?” “Old as I am,” replied the cobbler, “I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than I have now.” The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This means succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by him, right in front of Cassim’s house, the door of which the robber marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by Morgiana, going out, saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing, and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without saying anything to her master or mistress.\nThe thief, meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him show him the house he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba’s house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: “I have brought some oil from a distance to sell at to-morrow’s market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in.” Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant.\nHe bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: “As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice.” He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. “Do not be uneasy,” said Abdallah; “go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars.” Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: “Is it time?”\nAny other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly: “Not yet, but presently.” She went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and waited to see what would happen.\nIn a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying, “Are you asleep?” he smelt the hot boiled oil, and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.\nAt daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in terror. “Have no fear,” said Morgiana; “the man cannot harm you: he is dead.” Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. “Merchant!” said she, “he is no more a merchant than I am!” and she told him the whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali Baba’s garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves.\nThe Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town, where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba’s son. He called himself Cogia Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends with Ali Baba’s son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him into his house and received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his leave Ali Baba stopped him, saying: “Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?” The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba’s asking him what that was, he replied: “It is, sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt in them.” “If that is all,” said Ali Baba, “let me tell you that there shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night.”\n He went to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. “Who is this man,” she said, “who eats no salt with his meat?” “He is an honest man, Morgiana,” returned her master; “therefore do as I bid you.” But she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. “I am not surprised,” she said to herself, “that this wicked man, who intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him; but I will hinder his plans.”\nShe sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served, Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress like a dancing-girl’s, and clasped a girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: “Take your tabor, and let us go and divert our master and his guest.” Abdallah took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. “Come in, Morgiana,” said Ali Baba, “and let Cogia Hassan see what you can do”; and, turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: “She’s my slave and my housekeeper.” Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present; but he pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance. After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it at her own breast, sometimes at her master’s, as if it were part of the dance.\nSuddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the tabor to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it, and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged the dagger into his heart.\n“Unhappy girl!” cried Ali Baba and his son, “what have you done to ruin us?”\n“It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you,” answered Morgiana.\n“See here,” opening the false merchant’s garment and showing the dagger; “see what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt with you, and what more would you have? Look at him! he is both the false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves.”\nAli Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage, who readily consented, and a few days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor.\nAt the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave. The door opened on his saying: “Open Sesame!” He went in, and saw that nobody had been there since the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he could carry, and returned to town. He told his son the secret of the cave, which his son handed down in his turn, so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were rich to the end of their lives."

        "text": "HANSEL AND GRETTEL \n\nOnce upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel and the girl Grettel. He had always little enough to live on, and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he couldn’t even provide them with daily bread. One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: “What’s to become of us? how are we to support our poor children, now that we have nothing more for ourselves?” “I’ll tell you what, husband,” answered the woman; “early to-morrow morning we’ll take the children out into the thickest part of the wood; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of bread; then we’ll go on to our work and leave them alone. They won’t be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them.”\n “No, wife,” said her husband, “that I won’t do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood? The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.” “Oh! you fool,” said she, “then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins”; and she left him no peace till he consented.\n“But I can’t help feeling sorry for the poor children,” added the husband.\nThe children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel: “Now it’s all up with us.” “No, no, Grettel,” said Hansel, “don’t fret yourself; I’ll be able to find a way to escape, no fear.” And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out. The moon was shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver. Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in. Then he went back and said to Grettel: “Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep: God will not desert us”; and he lay down in bed again.\nAt daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: “Get up, you lie-abeds, we’re all going to the forest to fetch wood.” She gave them each a bit of bread and said: “There’s something for your luncheon, but don’t you eat it up before, for it’s all you’ll get.” Grettel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.\nAfter they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again. His father observed him, and said: “Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why do you always remain behind? Take care, and don’t lose your footing.”\n “Oh! father,” said Hansel, “I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell.” The woman exclaimed:\n“What a donkey you are! that isn’t your kitten, that’s the morning sun shining on the chimney.” But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: “Now, children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I’ll light a fire that you may not feel cold.” Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill. The brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said: “Now lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut down wood; when we’ve finished we’ll come back and fetch you.” Hansel and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits of bread. They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was quite near. But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind. And when they had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke at last it was pitch dark. Grettel began to cry, and said: “How are we ever to get out of the wood?” But Hansel comforted her. “Wait a bit,” he said, “till the moon is up, and then we’ll find our way sure enough.” And when the full moon had risen he took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new threepenny bits, and showed them the path. They walked on through the night, and at daybreak reached their father’s house again. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: “You naughty children, what a time you’ve slept in the wood! we thought you were never going to come back.” But the father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by themselves.\nNot long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night:\n“Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house, and when that’s done it’s all up with us. The children must be got rid of; we’ll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they won’t be able to find their way out again. There is no other way of saving ourselves.” The man’s heart smote him heavily, and he thought:\n“Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one’s children!”\n But his wife wouldn’t listen to his arguments, and did nothing but scold and reproach him. If a man yields once he’s done for, and so, because he had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the second.\nBut the children were awake, and had heard the conversation. When the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the door, and Hansel couldn’t get out. But he consoled his little sister, and said: “Don’t cry, Grettel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.”\nAt early dawn the woman came and made the children get up. They received their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before. On the way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground. “Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about you for?” said the father. “I’m looking back at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,”\n answered Hansel. “Fool!” said the wife; “that isn’t your pigeon, it’s the morning sun glittering on the chimney.” But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before. Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: “Just sit down there, children, and if you’re tired you can sleep a bit; we’re going into the forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we’re finished we’ll come back to fetch you.” At midday Grettel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path. Then they fell asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody came to the poor children.\nThey didn’t awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his sister, saying: “Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will show us the way back to the house.” When the moon appeared they got up, but they found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and fields had picked them all up. “Never mind,” said Hansel to Grettel; “you’ll see we’ll find a way out”; but all the same they did not. They wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood. They were very hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground. And at last they were so tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell fast asleep.\nOn the third morning after they had left their father’s house they set about their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must perish. At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it. And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them. They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar. “Now we’ll set to,” said Hansel, “and have a regular blow-out.(1) I’ll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel, can eat some of the window, which you’ll find a sweet morsel.” Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it.\nThereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside:\n  “Nibble, nibble, little mouse,   Who’s nibbling my house?”\nThe children answered:\n  “Tis Heaven’s own child,   The tempest wild,”\nand went on eating, without putting themselves about. Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better to enjoy it. Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on a staff hobbled out. Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that they let what they had in their hands fall. But the old woman shook her head and said: “Oh, ho! you dear children, who led you here? Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you.” She took them both by the hand and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before them milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts. After they had finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and when Hansel and Grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got into heaven.\n(1) He was a vulgar boy!\nThe old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread house in order to lure them in. When anyone came into her power she killed, cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the occasion. Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but, like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass by. When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly: “I’ve got them now; they sha’n’t escape me.” Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself: “That’ll be a dainty bite.” Then she seized Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him; he might scream as much as he liked, it did him no good. Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: “Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother. When he’s fat I’ll eat him up.” Grettel began to cry bitterly, but it was of no use; she had to do what the wicked witch bade her.\nSo the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Grettel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and cried: “Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting fat.” But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose eyes were dim, couldn’t see it, and thinking always it was Hansel’s finger, wondered why he fattened so slowly. When four weeks had passed and Hansel still remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer. “Hi, Grettel,” she called to the girl, “be quick and get some water. Hansel may be fat or thin, I’m going to kill him to-morrow and cook him.” Oh! how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks! “Kind heaven help us now!” she cried; “if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together.” “Just hold your peace,” said the old hag; “it won’t help you.”\nEarly in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. “First we’ll bake,” said the old dame; “I’ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough.” She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. “Creep in,” said the witch, “and see if it’s properly heated, so that we can shove in the bread.” For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: “I don’t know how I’m to do it; how do I get in?” “You silly goose!” said the hag, “the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself,” and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.\nGrettel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable-door, and cried: “Hansel, we are free; the old witch is dead.” Then Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened. How they rejoiced, and fell on each other’s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one another! And as they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hag’s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious stones. “These are even better than pebbles,”\n said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel said:\n“I too will bring something home,” and she filled her apron full. “But now,” said Hansel, “let’s go and get well away from the witch’s wood.”\n When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake.\n“We can’t get over,” said Hansel; “I see no bridge of any sort or kind.”\n “Yes, and there’s no ferry-boat either,” answered Grettel; “but look, there swims a white duck; if I ask her she’ll help us over,” and she called out:\n  “Here are two children, mournful very,   Seeing neither bridge nor ferry;   Take us upon your white back,   And row us over, quack, quack!”\nThe duck swam toward them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him. “No,” answered Grettel, “we should be too heavy a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately.” The good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw their father’s house in the distance. Then they set off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their father’s neck. The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, but the woman had died. Grettel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket. Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.\nMy story is done. See! there runs a little mouse; anyone who catches it may make himself a large fur cap out of it."

        "text": "SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED \n\nA poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red. She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red loved to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do. The two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about hand in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will never desert each other,” Rose-red answered: “No, not as long as we live”; and the mother added: “Whatever one gets she shall share with the other.” They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all their might.\nNo evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. And when they looked round about them they became aware that they had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness. And when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen must have been the angel that guards good children.\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose-red looked after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose. In winter Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said: “Snow-white, go and close the shutters,” and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat and span. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.\nOne evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he desired admittance. The mother said: “Rose-red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveler seeking shelter.” Rose-red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose-red screamed aloud and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak, and said: “Don’t be afraid: I won’t hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.” “My poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care you don’t burn your fur.”\n Then she called out: “Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will do you no harm; he is a good, honest creature.” So they both came out of their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life. They tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best possible good-nature, only when they went too far he cried: “Oh! children, spare my life!\n  “Snow-white and Rose-red,   Don’t beat your lover dead.”\nWhen it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: “You can lie there on the hearth, in heaven’s name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.” As soon as day dawned the children led him out, and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From this time on the bear came every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.\nWhen spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: “Now I must go away, and not return again the whole summer.” “Where are you going to, dear bear?” asked Snow-white. “I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.\nIn winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain underground, for they can’t work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.”\n Snow-white was quite sad over their friend’s departure, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of glittering gold beneath it, but she couldn’t be certain of it; and the bear ran hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.\nA short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to collect fagots. They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn’t distinguish. When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on a chain, and didn’t seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: “What are you standing there for? Can’t you come and help me?” “What were you doing, little man?” asked Rose-red. “You stupid, inquisitive goose!” replied the dwarf; “I wanted to split the tree, in order to get little chips of wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires for coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food we need. I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well, but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white beard out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can’t get away; and you silly, smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! what wretches you are!”\nThe children did all in their power, but they couldn’t get the beard out; it was wedged in far too firmly. “I will run and fetch somebody,”\n said Rose-red. “Crazy blockheads!” snapped the dwarf; “what’s the good of calling anyone else? You’re already two too many for me. Does nothing better occur to you than that?” “Don’t be so impatient,” said Snow-white, “I’ll see you get help,” and taking her scissors out of her pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: “Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!” With these words he swung the bag over his back, and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.\nShortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of fish. As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf.\n“Where are you going to?” asked Rose-red; “you’re surely not going to jump into the water?” “I’m not such a fool,” screamed the dwarf. “Don’t you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?” The little man had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every rush and blade of grass, but it didn’t help him much; he had to follow every movement of the fish, and was in great danger of being drawn into the water. The girls came up just at the right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless muddle. Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard, by which a small part of it was sacrificed.\nWhen the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: “Do you call that manners, you toad-stools! to disfigure a fellow’s face? It wasn’t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now needs cut off the best bit of it. I can’t appear like this before my own people. I wish you’d been in Jericho first.” Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\nIt happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them. Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.\nThe tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice:\n“Couldn’t you have treated me more carefully? You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!” Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them. “What are you standing there gaping for?”\n screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage.\nHe was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadn’t time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in terror: “Dear Mr.\nBear, spare me! I’ll give you all my treasure. Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! what pleasure would you get from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You won’t feel me between your teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven’s sake.”\n But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called after them: “Snow-white and Rose-red, don’t be afraid; wait, and I’ll come with you.” Then they recognized his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside them, all dressed in gold. “I am a king’s son,” he said, “and have been doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free. Now he has got his well-merited punishment.”\nSnow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them. The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and every year they bore the finest red and white roses."

        "text": "THE GOOSE-GIRL \n\nOnce upon a time an old queen, whose husband had been dead for many years, had a beautiful daughter. When she grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off. Now, when the time drew near for her to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom, her old mother gave her much costly baggage, and many ornaments, gold and silver, trinkets and knicknacks, and, in fact, everything that belonged to a royal trousseau, for she loved her daughter very dearly. She gave her a waiting-maid also, who was to ride with her and hand her over to the bridegroom, and she provided each of them with a horse for the journey.\nNow the Princess’s horse was called Falada, and could speak.\nWhen the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom, and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled; then she held a white rag under them, and letting three drops of blood fall into it, she gave it to her daughter, and said: “Dear child, take great care of this rag: it may be of use to you on the journey.”\nSo they took a sad farewell of each other, and the Princess stuck the rag in front of her dress, mounted her horse, and set forth on the journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom. After they had ridden for about an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her waiting-maid: “Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream: I would like a drink.” “If you’re thirsty,” said the maid, “dismount yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I don’t mean to be your servant any longer.” The Princess was so thirsty that she got down, bent over the stream, and drank, for she wasn’t allowed to drink out of the golden goblet. As she drank she murmured:\n“Oh! heaven, what am I to do?” and the three drops of blood replied:\n  “If your mother only knew,   Her heart would surely break in two.”\nBut the Princess was meek, and said nothing about her maid’s rude behavior, and quietly mounted her horse again. They rode on their way for several miles, but the day was hot, and the sun’s rays smote fiercely on them, so that the Princess was soon overcome by thirst again. And as they passed a brook she called once more to her waiting-maid: “Pray get down and give me a drink from my golden cup,” for she had long ago forgotten her maid’s rude words. But the waiting-maid replied, more haughtily even than before: “If you want a drink, you can dismount and get it; I don’t mean to be your servant.”\n Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down, and bending over the flowing water she cried and said: “Oh! heaven, what am I to do?” and the three drops of blood replied:\n  “If your mother only knew,   Her heart would surely break in two.”\nAnd as she drank thus, and leaned right over the water, the rag containing the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated down the stream, and she in her anxiety never even noticed her loss. But the waiting-maid had observed it with delight, as she knew it gave her power over the bride, for in losing the drops of blood the Princess had become weak and powerless. When she wished to get on her horse Falada again, the waiting-maid called out: “I mean to ride Falada: you must mount my beast”; and this too she had to submit to. Then the waiting-maid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes, and to put on her common ones, and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word about the matter when they reached the palace; and if she hadn’t taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada observed everything, and laid it all to heart.\nThe waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the real bride the worse horse, and so they continued their journey till at length they arrived at the palace yard. There was great rejoicing over the arrival, and the Prince sprang forward to meet them, and taking the waiting-maid for his bride, he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal chamber. In the meantime the real Princess was left standing below in the courtyard. The old King, who was looking out of his window, beheld her in this plight, and it struck him how sweet and gentle, even beautiful, she looked. He went at once to the royal chamber, and asked the bride who it was she had brought with her and had left thus standing in the court below. “Oh!” replied the bride, “I brought her with me to keep me company on the journey; give the girl something to do, that she may not be idle.” But the old King had no work for her, and couldn’t think of anything; so he said, “I’ve a small boy who looks after the geese, she’d better help him.” The youth’s name was Curdken, and the real bride was made to assist him in herding geese.\nSoon after this the false bride said to the Prince: “Dearest husband, I pray you grant me a favor.” He answered: “That I will.” “Then let the slaughterer cut off the head of the horse I rode here upon, because it behaved very badly on the journey.” But the truth was she was afraid lest the horse should speak and tell how she had treated the Princess.\nShe carried her point, and the faithful Falada was doomed to die.\nWhen the news came to the ears of the real Princess she went to the slaughterer, and secretly promised him a piece of gold if he would do something for her. There was in the town a large dark gate, through which she had to pass night and morning with the geese; would he “kindly hang up Falada’s head there, that she might see it once again?” The slaughterer said he would do as she desired, chopped off the head, and nailed it firmly over the gateway.\nEarly next morning, as she and Curdken were driving their flock through the gate, she said as she passed under:\n  “Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there”; \nand the head replied:\n  “‘Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:\n  If your mother only knew,   Her heart would surely break in two.”\nThen she left the tower and drove the geese into a field. And when they had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed her hair, which was of pure gold. Curdken loved to see it glitter in the sun, and wanted much to pull some hair out. Then she spoke:\n  “Wind, wind, gently sway,   Blow Curdken’s hat away;   Let him chase o’er field and wold   Till my locks of ruddy gold,   Now astray and hanging down,   Be combed and plaited in a crown.”\nThen a gust of wind blew Curdken’s hat away, and he had to chase it over hill and dale. When he returned from the pursuit she had finished her combing and curling, and his chance of getting any hair was gone.\nCurdken was very angry, and wouldn’t speak to her. So they herded the geese till evening and then went home.\nThe next morning, as they passed under the gate, the girl said:\n  “Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there;”\nand the head replied:\n  “‘Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:\n  If your mother only knew,   Her heart would surely break in two.”\nThen she went on her way till she came to the common, where she sat down and began to comb out her hair; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head, but she called out hastily:\n  “Wind, wind, gently sway,   Blow Curdken’s hat away;   Let him chase o’er field and wold   Till my locks of ruddy gold,   Now astray and hanging down,   Be combed and plaited in a crown.”\nThen a puff of wind came and blew Curdken’s hat far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he returned she had long finished putting up her golden locks, and he couldn’t get any hair; so they watched the geese till it was dark.\nBut that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King, and said: “I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl.” “For what reason?” asked the old King. “Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long,” replied Curdken; and he proceeded to relate all her iniquities, and said: “Every morning as we drive the flock through the dark gate she says to a horse’s head that hangs on the wall:\n     “‘Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there’; \nand the head replies:\n     “‘’Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:\n     If your mother only knew,      Her heart would surely break in two.’”\nAnd Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese fed, and how he had always to chase his hat.\nThe old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day; and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark gate, and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada. Then he followed her through the field, and hid himself behind a bush on the common. He soon saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after the geese, and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair, that glittered like gold, and repeated:\n  “Wind, wind, gently sway,   Blow Curdken’s hat away;   Let him chase o’er field and wold   Till my locks of ruddy gold   Now astray and hanging down,   Be combed and plaited in a crown.”\nThen a gust of wind came and blew Curdken’s hat away, so that he had to fly over hill and dale after it, and the girl in the meantime quietly combed and plaited her hair: all this the old King observed, and returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him. In the evening when the goose-girl came home he called her aside, and asked her why she behaved as she did. “I may not tell you why; how dare I confide my woes to anyone? for I swore not to by heaven, otherwise I should have lost my life.” The old King begged her to tell him all, and left her no peace, but he could get nothing out of her. At last he said: “Well, if you won’t tell me, confide your trouble to the iron stove there,” and he went away. Then she crept to the stove, and began to sob and cry and to pour out her poor little heart, and said: “Here I sit, deserted by all the world, I who am a king’s daughter, and a false waiting-maid has forced me to take off my own clothes, and has taken my place with my bridegroom, while I have to fulfill the lowly office of goose-girl.\n  “If my mother only knew   Her heart would surely break in two.”\nBut the old King stood outside at the stove chimney, and listened to her words. Then he entered the room again, and bidding her leave the stove, he ordered royal apparel to be put on her, in which she looked amazingly lovely. Then he summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the false bride, who was nothing but a waiting-maid, while the real one, in the guise of the ex-goose-girl, was standing at his side. The young King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was, and a great banquet was prepared, to which everyone was bidden.\nThe bridegroom sat at the head of the table, the Princess on one side of him and the waiting-maid on the other; but she was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments. Now when they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the old King asked the waiting-maid to solve a knotty point for him. “What,” said he, “should be done to a certain person who has deceived everyone?” and he proceeded to relate the whole story, ending up with, “Now what sentence should be passed?”\n Then the false bride answered: “She deserves to be put stark naked into a barrel lined with sharp nails, which should be dragged by two white horses up and down the street till she is dead.”\n“You are the person,” said the King, “and you have passed sentence on yourself; and even so it shall be done to you.” And when the sentence had been carried out the young King was married to his real bride, and both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness."

        "text": "TOADS AND DIAMONDS \n\nThere was once upon a time a widow who had two daughters. The eldest was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them.\nThe youngest, who was the very picture of her father for courtesy and sweetness of temper, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen. As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother even doted on her eldest daughter and at the same time had a horrible aversion for the youngest she made her eat in the kitchen and work continually.\nAmong other things, this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water above a mile and a-half off the house, and bring home a pitcher full of it. One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink.\n“Oh! ay, with all my heart, Goody,” said this pretty little girl; and rinsing immediately the pitcher, she took up some water from the clearest place of the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier.\nThe good woman, having drunk, said to her:\n“You are so very pretty, my dear, so good and so mannerly, that I cannot help giving you a gift.” For this was a fairy, who had taken the form of a poor country woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go. “I will give you for a gift,” continued the Fairy, “that, at every word you speak, there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel.”\nWhen this pretty girl came home her mother scolded her for staying so long at the fountain.\n“I beg your pardon, mamma,” said the poor girl, “for not making more haste.”\nAnd in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses, two pearls, and two diamonds.\n“What is it I see there?” said the mother, quite astonished. “I think I see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl’s mouth! How happens this, child?”\nThis was the first time she had ever called her child.\nThe poor creature told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out infinite numbers of diamonds.\n“In good faith,” cried the mother, “I must send my child thither.\nCome hither, Fanny; look what comes out of thy sister’s mouth when she speaks. Wouldst not thou be glad, my dear, to have the same gift given thee? Thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly.”\n“It would be a very fine sight indeed,” said this ill-bred minx, “to see me go draw water.”\n“You shall go, hussy!” said the mother; “and this minute.”\nSo away she went, but grumbling all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house.\nShe was no sooner at the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood a lady most gloriously dressed, who came up to her, and asked to drink.\nThis was, you must know, the very fairy who appeared to her sister, but now had taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl’s rudeness would go.\n“Am I come hither,” said the proud, saucy one, “to serve you with water, pray? I suppose the silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy.”\n“You are not over and above mannerly,” answered the Fairy, without putting herself in a passion. “Well, then, since you have so little breeding, and are so disobliging, I give you for a gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad.”\nSo soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out:\n“Well, daughter?”\n“Well, mother?” answered the pert hussy, throwing out of her mouth two vipers and two toads.\n“Oh! mercy,” cried the mother; “what is it I see? Oh! it is that wretch her sister who has occasioned all this; but she shall pay for it”; and immediately she ran to beat her. The poor child fled away from her, and went to hide herself in the forest, not far from thence.\nThe King’s son, then on his return from hunting, met her, and seeing her so very pretty, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried.\n“Alas! sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors.”\nThe King’s son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened. She thereupon told him the whole story; and so the King’s son fell in love with her, and, considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion, conducted her to the palace of the King his father, and there married her.\nAs for the sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her off; and the miserable wretch, having wandered about a good while without finding anybody to take her in, went to a corner of the wood, and there died."

        "text": "TRUSTY JOHN \n\nOnce upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to himself, “I am most likely on my death-bed.” Then he said, “Send Trusty John to me.” Now Trusty John was his favorite servant, and was so called because all his life he had served him so faithfully. When he approached the bed the King spake to him: “Most trusty John, I feel my end is drawing near, and I could face it without a care were it not for my son.\nHe is still too young to decide everything for himself, and unless you promise me to instruct him in all he should know, and to be to him as a father, I shall not close my eyes in peace.” Then Trusty John answered:\n“I will never desert him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it should cost me my life.” Then the old King said: “Now I die comforted and in peace”; and then he went on: “After my death you must show him the whole castle, all the rooms and apartments and vaults, and all the treasures that lie in them; but you must not show him the last room in the long passage, where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof is hidden. When he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love with it and go off into a dead faint, and for her sake he will encounter many dangers; you must guard him from this.” And when Trusty John had again given the King his hand upon it the old man became silent, laid his head on the pillow, and died.\nWhen the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed, and added:\n“And I shall assuredly keep my word, and shall be faithful to you as I have been to him, even though it should cost me my life.”\nNow when the time of mourning was over, Trusty John said to him: “It is time you should see your inheritance. I will show you your ancestral castle.” So he took him over everything, and let him see all the riches and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he did not open. But the picture was placed so that if the door opened you gazed straight upon it, and it was so beautifully painted that you imagined it lived and moved, and that it was the most lovable and beautiful thing in the whole world. But the young King noticed that Trusty John always missed one door, and said: “Why do you never open this one for me?” “There is something inside that would appall you,” he answered. But the King replied: “I have seen the whole castle, and shall find out what is in there”; and with these words he approached the door and wanted to force it open. But Trusty John held him back, and said: “I promised your father before his death that you shouldn’t see what that room contains. It might bring both you and me to great grief.” “Ah!\nno,” answered the young King; “if I don’t get in, it will be my certain destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what was in the room with my own eyes. Now I don’t budge from the spot till you have opened the door.”\nThen Trusty John saw there was no way out of it, so with a heavy heart and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch. When he had opened the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless: the King stood on tiptoe and looked over his shoulder. And when he saw the picture of the maid, so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones, he fell swooning to the ground. Trusty John lifted him up, carried him to bed, and thought sorrowfully: “The curse has come upon us; gracious heaven!\nwhat will be the end of it all?” Then he poured wine down his throat till he came to himself again. The first words he spoke were: “Oh! who is the original of the beautiful picture?” “She is the Princess of the Golden Roof,” answered Trusty John. Then the King continued: “My love for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they could not express it; my very life depends on my winning her. You are my most trusty John: you must stand by me.”\nThe faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the matter, for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of the Princess. At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: “All the things she has about her tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls, and all her household furniture are made of gold. You have in your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her. We shall go to her with them and try our luck.” The King summoned all his goldsmiths, and they had to work hard day and night, till at length the most magnificent things were completed. When a ship had been laden with them the faithful John disguised himself as a merchant, and the King had to do the same, so that they should be quite unrecognizable. And so they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt.\nTrusty John made the King remain behind on the ship and await his return. “Perhaps,” he said, “I may bring the Princess back with me, so see that everything is in order; let the gold ornaments be arranged and the whole ship decorated.” Then he took a few of the gold things in his apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace. When he came to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well, drawing water with two golden pails. And as she was about to carry away the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger, and asked him who he was. Then he replied: “I am a merchant,” and opening his apron, he let her peep in. “Oh! my,” she cried; “what beautiful gold wares!” she set down her pails, and examined one thing after the other.\nThen she said: “The Princess must see this, she has such a fancy for gold things that she will buy up all you have.” She took him by the hand and let him into the palace, for she was the lady’s maid.\nWhen the Princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted, and said:\n“They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have.”\n But Trusty John said: “I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been made in gold before.” She desired to have everything brought up to her, but he said: “There is such a quantity of things that it would take many days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that you would have no space for them in your house.” Thus her desire and curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said: “Take me to your ship; I shall go there myself and view your master’s treasures.”\nThen Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst. She stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside. But Trusty John remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off.\n“Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air.”\n Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every single bit of it dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all the wonderful beasts. Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that she did not notice that the ship was sailing away. After she had seen the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but when she came to the ship’s side she saw that they were on the high seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under full canvas. “Oh!” she cried in terror, “I am deceived, carried away and betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!” But the King seized her hand and spake: “I am no merchant, but a king of as high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me carry you off by stratagem. The first time I saw your likeness I fell to the ground in a swoon.” When the Princess of the Golden Roof heard this she was comforted, and her heart went out to him, so that she willingly consented to become his wife.\nNow it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him. He ceased playing, and listened to what they were saying, for he understood their language. The one croaked: “Ah, ha! so he’s bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home.” “Yes,” answered the second, “but he’s not got her yet.” “Yes, he has,” spake the third, “for she’s sitting beside him on the ship.” Then number one began again and cried: “That’ll not help him!\nWhen they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again.” “Is there no escape for him?” asked number two. “Oh! yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved. But who’s to do that? And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees.” Then spake number two: “I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.”\n Number three asked: “Is there no way of escape, then?” “Oh! yes,”\n answered number two: “If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved.\nBut what’s the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.” Then number three spake: “I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn’t even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.” When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life. At last he said: “I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin.”\nNow when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward. “Capital!”\n said the King; “this animal shall carry me to my palace,” and was about to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead.\nThen the other servants of the King, who at no time looked favorably on Trusty John, cried out: “What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was to bear the King to his palace!” But the King spake: “Silence! let him alone; he is ever my most trusty John. Who knows for what good end he may have done this thing?” So they went on their way and entered the palace, and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the ready-made bridal shirt, looking for all the world as though it were made of gold and silver. The young King went toward it and was about to take hold of it, but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn The other servants commenced grumbling again, and said: “See, he’s actually burning the King’s bridal shirt.” But the young King spoke: “Who knows for what good purpose he does it? Let him alone, he is my most trusty John.” Then the wedding was celebrated, the dance began, and the bride joined in, but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully. Of a sudden she grew deadly white, and fell to the ground as if she were dead. He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out. She soon breathed again and came to herself; but the young King had watched the proceeding, and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did, he flew into a passion, and cried: “Throw him into prison.” On the following morning sentence was passed on Trusty John, and he was condemned to be hanged. As he stood on the gallows he said: “Every one doomed to death has the right to speak once before he dies; and I too have that privilege?” “Yes,” said the King, “it shall be granted to you.” So Trusty John spoke: “I am unjustly condemned, for I have always been faithful to you”; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the ravens’ conversation on the sea, and how he had to do all he did in order to save his master. Then the King cried: “Oh! my most trusty John, pardon! pardon! Take him down.” But as he uttered the last word Trusty John had fallen lifeless to the ground, and was a stone.\nThe King and Queen were in despair, and the King spake: “Ah! how ill have I rewarded such great fidelity!” and made them lift up the stone image and place it in his bedroom near his bed. As often as he looked at it he wept and said: “Oh! if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!” After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her. One day when the Queen was at church, and the two children sat and played with their father, he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue, and sighing, wailed: “Oh, if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!”\n Suddenly the stone began to speak, and said: “Yes, you can restore me to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear.”\n And the King cried out: “All I have in the world will I give up for your sake.” The stone continued: “If you cut off with your own hand the heads of your two children, and smear me with their blood, I shall come back to life.” The King was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put his children to death; but when he thought of Trusty John’s fidelity, and how he had even died for him, he drew his sword, and with his own hand cut the heads off his children. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life came back, and Trusty John stood once more safe and sound before him. He spake to the King: “Your loyalty shall be rewarded,” and taking up the heads of the children, he placed them on their bodies, smeared the wounds with their blood, and in a minute they were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened.\nThen the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming, he hid Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard. As she entered he said to her: “Did you pray in church?” “Yes,” she answered, “but my thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John, and of what he has suffered for us.” Then he spake: “Dear wife, we can restore him to life, but the price asked is our two little sons; we must sacrifice them.” The Queen grew white and her heart sank, but she replied: “We owe it to him on account of his great fidelity.” Then he rejoiced that she was of the same mind as he had been, and going forward he opened the cupboard, and fetched the two children and Trusty John out, saying: “God be praised!\nTrusty John is free once more, and we have our two small sons again.”\n Then he related to her all that had passed, and they lived together happily ever afterward."

        "text": "Rotkäppchen.\n\nEs war einmal ein kleines süsses Mädchen, das hatte jedermann lieb, der sie nur ansah, am allerliebsten aber ihre Grossmutter, die wusste gar nicht was sie alles dem Kinde geben sollte. Einmal schenkte sie ihm ein Käppchen aus rotem Sammt, und weil ihm das so wohl stand, und es nichts anders mehr tragen wollte, hiess es nur noch das Rotkäppchen. Eines Tages sprach seine Mutter zu ihm „komm, Rotkäppchen, da hast du ein Stück Kuchen und eine Flasche Wein, bring das der Grossmutter hinaus; sie ist krank und schwach und wird sich daran laben. Mach dich auf bevor es heiss wird, und wenn du hinaus kommst, so geh hübsch sittsam und lauf nicht vom Weg ab, sonst fällst du und zerbrichst das Glas und die Grossmutter hat nichts. Und wenn du in ihre Stube kommst, so vergiss nicht guten Morgen zu sagen und guck nicht erst in alle Ecken herum.“\n\n„Ich will schon alles gut machen“ sagte Rotkäppchen zur Mutter, und gab ihr die Hand darauf. Die Grossmutter aber wohnte draussen im Wald, eine halbe Stunde vom Dorf. Wie nun Rotkäppchen in den Wald kam, begegnete ihm der Wolf. Rotkäppchen aber wusste nicht was das für ein böses Tier war und fürchtete sich nicht vor ihm. „Guten Tag, Rotkäppchen,“ sprach er. „Schönen Dank, Wolf.“ „Wo hinaus so früh, Rotkäppchen?“ „Zur Grossmutter.“ „Was trägst du unter der Schürze?“ „Kuchen und Wein: gestern haben wir gebacken, da soll sich die kranke und schwache Grossmutter etwas zu gut tun, und sich damit stärken.“ „Rotkäppchen, wo wohnt deine Grossmutter?“ „Noch eine gute Viertelstunde weiter im Wald, unter den drei grossen Eichbäumen, da steht ihr Haus, unten sind die Nusshecken, das wirst du ja wissen“ sagte Rotkäppchen. Der Wolf dachte bei sich „das junge zarte Ding, das ist ein fetter Bissen, der wird noch besser schmecken als die Alte. Du musst es listig anfangen, damit du beide erschnappst.“ Da gieng er ein Weilchen neben Rotkäppchen her, dann sprach er „Rotkäppchen, sieh einmal die schönen Blumen, die rings umher stehen, warum guckst du dich nicht um? ich glaube du hörst gar nicht, wie die Vöglein so lieblich singen? du gehst ja für dich hin als wenn du zur Schule giengst, und ist so lustig haussen in dem Wald.“\n\nRotkäppchen schlug die Augen auf, und als es sah wie die Sonnenstrahlen durch die Bäume hin und her tanzten, und alles voll schöner Blumen stand, dachte es „wenn ich der Grossmutter einen frischen Strauss mitbringe, der wird ihr auch Freude machen; es ist so früh am Tag, dass ich doch zu rechter Zeit ankomme,“ lief vom Wege ab in den Wald hinein und suchte Blumen. Und wenn es eine gebrochen hatte, meinte es weiter hinaus stände eine schönere, und lief darnach, und geriet immer tiefer in den Wald hinein. Der Wolf aber gieng geradeswegs nach dem Haus der Grossmutter, und klopfte an die Türe. „Wer ist draussen?“ „Rotkäppchen, das bringt Kuchen und Wein, mach auf.“ „Drück nur auf die Klinke,“ rief die Grossmutter, „ich bin zu schwach und kann nicht aufstehen.“ Der Wolf drückte auf die Klinke, die Türe sprang auf und er gieng, ohne ein Wort zu sprechen, gerade zum Bett der Grossmutter und verschluckte sie. Dann tat er ihre Kleider an, setzte ihre Haube auf, legte sich in ihr Bett und zog die Vorhänge vor.\n\nRotkäppchen aber war nach den Blumen herum gelaufen, und als es so viel zusammen hatte, dass es keine mehr tragen konnte, fiel ihm die Grossmutter wieder ein und es machte sich auf den Weg zu ihr. Es wunderte sich dass die Türe aufstand, und wie es in die Stube trat, so kam es ihm so seltsam darin vor, dass es dachte „ei, du mein Gott, wie ängstlich wird mirs heute zu Mut, und bin sonst so gerne bei der Grossmutter!“ Es rief „guten Morgen,“ bekam aber keine Antwort. Darauf gieng es zum Bett und zog die Vorhänge zurück. Da lag die Grossmutter, und hatte die Haube tief ins Gesicht gesetzt und sah so wunderlich aus. „Ei, Grossmutter, was hast du für grosse Ohren!“ „Dass ich dich besser hören kann.“ „Ei, Grossmutter, was hast du für grosse Augen!“ „Dass ich dich besser sehen kann.“ „Ei, Grossmutter, was hast du für grosse Hände!“ „Dass ich dich besser packen kann.“ „Aber, Grossmutter, was hast du für ein entsetzlich grosses Maul!“ „Dass ich dich besser fressen kann.“ Kaum hatte der Wolf das gesagt, so tat er einen Satz aus dem Bette und verschlang das arme Rotkäppchen.\n\nWie der Wolf sein Gelüsten gestillt hatte, legte er sich wieder ins Bett, schlief ein und fieng an überlaut zu schnarchen. Der Jäger gieng eben an dem Haus vorbei und dachte „wie die alte Frau schnarcht, du musst doch sehen ob ihr etwas fehlt.“ Da trat er in die Stube, und wie er vor das Bette kam, so sah er dass der Wolf darin lag. „Finde ich dich hier, du alter Sünder,“ sagte er, „ich habe dich lange gesucht.“ Nun wollte er seine Büchse anlegen, da fiel ihm ein der Wolf könnte die Grossmutter gefressen haben, und sie wäre noch zu retten. Er schoss nicht, sondern nahm eine Scheere und fieng an dem schlafenden Wolf den Bauch aufzuschneiden. Wie er ein paar Schnitte getan hatte, da sah er das rote Käppchen leuchten, und noch ein paar Schnitte, da sprang das Mädchen heraus und rief „ach, wie war ich erschrocken, wie wars so dunkel in dem Wolf seinem Leib!“ Und dann kam die alte Grossmutter auch noch lebendig heraus und konnte kaum atmen. Rotkäppchen aber holte geschwind grosse Steine, damit füllten sie dem Wolf den Leib, und wie er aufwachte, wollte er fortspringen, aber die Steine waren so schwer, dass er gleich niedersank und sich todt fiel.\n\nDa waren alle drei vergnügt; der Jäger zog dem Wolf den Pelz ab und gieng damit heim, die Grossmutter ass den Kuchen und trank den Wein den Rotkäppchen gebracht hatte, und erholte sich wieder, Rotkäppchen aber dachte „du willst dein Lebtag nicht wieder allein vom Wege ab in den Wald laufen, wenn dirs die Mutter verboten hat.“\n\nEs wird auch erzählt, dass einmal, als Rotkäppchen der alten Grossmutter wieder Gebackenes brachte, ein anderer Wolf ihm zugesprochen und es vom Wege habe ableiten wollen. Rotkäppchen aber hütete sich und gieng gerade fort seines Wegs und sagte der Grossmutter dass es dem Wolf begegnet wäre, der ihm guten Tag gewünscht, aber so bös aus den Augen geguckt hätte: „wenns nicht auf offner Strasse gewesen wäre, er hätte mich gefressen.“ „Komm,“ sagte die Grossmutter, „wir wollen die Türe verschliessen, dass er nicht herein kann.“ Bald darnach klopfte der Wolf an und rief „mach auf, Grossmutter, ich bin das Rotkäppchen, ich bring dir Gebackenes.“ Sie schwiegen aber still und machten die Türe nicht auf. Da schlich der Graukopf etlichemal um das Haus, sprang endlich aufs Dach und wollte warten bis Rotkäppchen Abends nach Haus gienge, dann wollte er ihm nachschleichen und wollts in der Dunkelheit fressen. Aber die Grossmutter merkte was er im Sinn hatte. Nun stand vor dem Haus ein grosser Steintrog, da sprach sie zu dem Kind „nimm den Eimer, Rotkäppchen, gestern hab ich Würste gekocht, da trag das Wasser, worin sie gekocht sind, in den Trog.“ Rotkäppchen trug so lange, bis der grosse grosse Trog ganz voll war. Da stieg der Geruch von den Würsten dem Wolf in die Nase, er schnupperte und guckte hinab, endlich machte er den Hals so lang, dass er sich nicht mehr halten konnte, und anfieng zu rutschen. So rutschte er vom Dach herab, gerade in den grossen Trog hinein und ertrank. Rotkäppchen aber gieng fröhlich nach Haus, und tat ihm niemand etwas zu Leid."

        "text": "Der Wolf und die sieben jungen Geislein.\n\nEs war einmal eine alte Geis, die hatte sieben junge Geislein, und hatte sie lieb, wie eine Mutter ihre Kinder lieb hat. Eines Tages wollte sie in den Wald gehen und Futter holen, da rief sie alle sieben herbei und sprach „liebe Kinder, ich will hinaus in den Wald, seid auf eurer Hut vor dem Wolf, wenn er herein kommt, so frisst er Euch alle mit Haut und Haar. Der Bösewicht verstellt sich oft, aber an seiner rauhen Stimme und an seinen schwarzen Füssen werdet ihr ihn gleich erkennen.“ Die Geislein sagten, „liebe Mutter, wir wollen uns schon in Acht nehmen, Ihr könnt ohne Sorge fortgehen.“ Da meckerte die Alte und machte sich getrost auf den Weg.\n\nEs dauerte nicht lange, so klopfte jemand an die Haustür und rief „macht auf, ihr lieben Kinder, eure Mutter ist da und hat jedem von Euch etwas mitgebracht.“ Aber die Geiserchen hörten an der rauhen Stimme dass es der Wolf war, „wir machen nicht auf,“ riefen sie, „du bist unsere Mutter nicht, die hat eine feine und liebliche Stimme, aber deine Stimme ist rauh; du bist der Wolf.“ Da gieng der Wolf fort zu einem Krämer, und kaufte sich ein grosses Stück Kreide. Die ass er und machte damit seine Stimme fein. Dann kam er zurück, klopfte an die Haustür und rief „macht auf, ihr lieben Kinder, eure Mutter ist da und hat jedem von Euch etwas mitgebracht.“ Aber der Wolf hatte seine schwarze Pfote in das Fenster gelegt, das sahen die Kinder und riefen „wir machen nicht auf, unsere Mutter hat keinen schwarzen Fuss, wie du. Du bist der Wolf.“ Da lief der Wolf zu einem Bäcker und sprach „ich habe mich an den Fuss gestossen, streich mir Teig darüber.“ Und als ihm der Bäcker die Pfote bestrichen hatte, so lief er zum Müller und sprach „streu mir weisses Mehl auf meine Pfote.“ Der Müller dachte „der Wolf will einen betrügen“ und weigerte sich, aber der Wolf sprach „wenn du es nicht tust, so fresse ich dich.“ Da fürchtete sich der Müller und machte ihm die Pfote weiss. Ja, das sind die Menschen.\n\nNun gieng der Bösewicht zum drittenmal zu der Haustüre, klopfte an und sprach „macht mir auf, Kinder, euer liebes Mütterchen ist heim gekommen und hat jedem von Euch etwas aus dem Walde mitgebracht.“ Die Geiserchen riefen „zeig uns erst deine Pfote, damit wir wissen dass du unser liebes Mütterchen bist.“ Da legte er die Pfote ins Fenster, und als sie sahen dass sie weiss war, so glaubten sie es wäre alles wahr, was er sagte, und machten die Türe auf. Wer aber hereinkam, das war der Wolf. Sie erschraken und wollten sich verstecken. Das eine sprang unter den Tisch, das zweite ins Bett, das dritte in den Ofen, das vierte in die Küche, das fünfte in den Schrank, das sechste unter die Waschschüssel, das siebente in den Kasten der Wanduhr. Aber der Wolf fand sie alle und machte nicht langes Federlesen. Eins nach dem andern schluckte er in seinen Rachen; nur das jüngste in dem Uhrkasten das fand er nicht. Als der Wolf seine Lust gebüsst hatte, trollte er sich fort, legte sich draussen auf der grünen Wiese unter einen Baum und fieng an zu schlafen.\n\nNicht lange danach kam die alte Geis aus dem Walde wieder heim. Ach, was musste sie da erblicken! Die Haustüre stand sperrweit auf. Tisch, Stühle und Bänke waren umgeworfen, die Waschschüssel lag in Scherben, Decke und Kissen waren aus dem Bett gezogen. Sie suchte ihre Kinder, aber nirgend waren sie zu finden. Sie rief sie nacheinander bei Namen, aber niemand antwortete. Endlich als sie an das jüngste kam, da rief eine feine Stimme „liebe Mutter, ich stecke im Uhrkasten.“ Sie holte es heraus, und es erzählte ihr dass der Wolf gekommen wäre und die andern alle gefressen hätte. Da könnt ihr denken wie sie über ihre armen Kinder geweint hat.\n\nEndlich gieng sie in ihrem Jammer hinaus, und das jüngste Geislein lief mit. Als sie auf die Wiese kam, so lag da der Wolf an dem Baum und schnarchte dass die Äste zitterten. Sie betrachtete ihn von allen Seiten, und sah dass in seinem angefüllten Bauch sich etwas regte und zappelte. „Ach Gott,“ dachte sie, „sollten meine armen Kinder, die er zum Abendbrot hinunter gewürgt hat, noch am Leben sein?“ Da musste das Geislein nach Haus laufen und Scheere, Nadel und Zwirn holen. Dann schnitt sie dem Ungetüm den Wanst auf, und kaum hatte sie einen Schnitt getan, so streckte schon ein Geislein den Kopf heraus, und als sie weiter schnitt, so sprangen nacheinander alle sechse heraus, und waren noch alle am Leben, und hatten nicht einmal Schaden gelitten, denn das Ungetüm hatte sie in der Gier ganz hinunter geschluckt. Das war eine Freude! Da herzten sie ihre liebe Mutter, und hüpften wie ein Schneider, der Hochzeit hält. Die Alte aber sagte „jetzt geht und sucht Wackersteine, damit wollen wir dem gottlosen Tier den Bauch füllen, so lange es noch im Schlafe liegt.“ Da schleppten die sieben Geiserchen in aller Eile die Steine herbei und steckten sie ihm in den Bauch, so viel sie hinein bringen konnten. Dann nähte ihn die Alte in aller Geschwindigkeit wieder zu, dass er nichts merkte und sich nicht einmal regte.\n\nAls der Wolf endlich ausgeschlafen hatte, machte er sich auf die Beine, und weil ihm die Steine im Magen so grossen Durst erregten, so wollte er zu einem Brunnen gehen und trinken. Als er aber anfieng zu gehen und sich hin und her zu bewegen, so stiessen die Steine in seinem Bauch aneinander und rappelten. Da rief er\n\n„was rumpelt und pumpelt\nin meinem Bauch herum?\nich meinte es wären sechs Geislein,\nso sinds lauter Wackerstein.“\n\nUnd als er an den Brunnen kam und sich über das Wasser bückte und trinken wollte, da zogen ihn die schweren Steine hinein, und er musste jämmerlich ersaufen. Als die sieben Geislein das sahen, da kamen sie herbei gelaufen, riefen laut „der Wolf ist todt! der Wolf ist todt!“ und tanzten mit ihrer Mutter vor Freude um den Brunnen herum."

        "text": "König Drosselbart.\n\nEin König hatte eine Tochter, die war über alle Massen schön, aber dabei so stolz und übermütig, dass ihr kein Freier gut genug war. Sie wies einen nach dem andern ab, und trieb noch dazu Spott mit ihnen. Einmal liess der König ein grosses Fest anstellen, und ladete dazu aus der Nähe und Ferne die heiratslustigen Männer ein. Sie wurden alle in eine Reihe nach Rang und Stand geordnet; erst kamen die Könige, dann die Herzöge, die Fürsten, Grafen und Freiherrn, zuletzt die Edelleute. Nun ward die Königstochter durch die Reihen geführt, aber an jedem hatte sie etwas auszusetzen. Der eine war ihr zu dick, „das Weinfass!“ sprach sie. Der andere zu lang, „lang und schwank hat keinen Gang.“ Der dritte zu kurz, „kurz und dick hat kein Geschick.“ Der vierte zu blass, „der bleiche Tod!“ der fünfte zu rot, „der Zinshahn!“ der sechste war nicht gerad genug, „grünes Holz, hinterm Ofen getrocknet!“ Und so hatte sie an einem jeden etwas auszusetzen, besonders aber machte sie sich über einen guten König lustig, der ganz oben stand, und dem das Kinn ein wenig krumm gewachsen war. „Ei,“ rief sie und lachte, „der hat ein Kinn, wie die Drossel einen Schnabel;“ und seit der Zeit bekam er den Namen Drosselbart. Der alte König aber, als er sah dass seine Tochter nichts tat als über die Leute spotten, und alle Freier, die da versammelt waren, verschmähte, ward er zornig und schwur, sie sollte den ersten besten Bettler zum Manne nehmen, der vor seine Türe käme.\n\nEin paar Tage darauf hub ein Spielmann an unter dem Fenster zu singen, um damit ein geringes Almosen zu verdienen. Als es der König hörte, sprach er „lasst ihn herauf kommen.“ Da trat der Spielmann in seinen schmutzigen verlumpten Kleidern herein, sang vor dem König und seiner Tochter, und bat, als er fertig war, um eine milde Gabe. Der König sprach „dein Gesang hat mir so wohl gefallen, dass ich dir meine Tochter da zur Frau geben will.“ Die Königstochter erschrack, aber der König sagte „ich habe den Eid getan, dich dem ersten besten Bettelmann zu geben, den will ich auch halten.“ Es half keine Einrede, der Pfarrer ward geholt, und sie musste sich gleich mit dem Spielmann trauen lassen. Als das geschehen war, sprach der König, „nun schickt sichs nicht, dass du als ein Bettelweib noch länger in meinem Schloss bleibst, du kannst nur mit deinem Manne fortziehen.“\n\nDer Bettelmann führte sie an der Hand hinaus, und sie musste mit ihm zu Fuss fort gehen. Als sie in einen grossen Wald kamen, da fragte sie\n\n„ach, wem gehört der schöne Wald?“\n„Der gehört dem König Drosselbart;\nhättst du ihn genommen, so wär er dein.“\n„Ich arme Jungfer zart,\nach, hätt ich genommen den König Drosselbart!“\n\nDarauf kamen sie über eine Wiese, da fragte sie wieder\n\n„wem gehört die schöne grüne Wiese?“\n„Sie gehört dem König Drosselbart;\nhättst du ihn genommen, so wär sie dein.“\n„Ich arme Jungfer zart,\nach, hätt ich genommen den König Drosselbart!“\n\nDann kamen sie durch eine grosse Stadt, da fragte sie wieder\n\n„wem gehört diese schöne grosse Stadt?“\n„Sie gehört dem König Drosselbart;\nhättst du ihn genommen, so wär sie dein.“\n„Ich arme Jungfer zart, ach, hätt ich genommen den König Drosselbart!“\n\n„Es gefällt mir gar nicht,“ sprach der Spielmann, „dass du dir immer einen andern zum Mann wünschest. Bin ich dir nicht gut genug?“ Endlich kamen sie an ein ganz kleines Häuschen, da sprach sie\n\n„ach, Gott, was ist das Haus so klein!\nwem mag das elende winzige Häuschen sein?“\n\nDer Spielmann antwortete „das ist mein und dein Haus, wo wir zusammen wohnen.“ Sie musste sich bücken, damit sie zu der niedrigen Tür hinein kam. „Wo sind die Diener?“ sprach die Königstochter. „Was Diener!“ antwortete der Bettelmann, „du musst selber tun was du willst getan haben. Mach nur gleich Feuer an und stell Wasser auf, dass du mir mein Essen kochst; ich bin ganz müde.“ Die Königstochter verstand aber nichts vom Feueranmachen und Kochen, und der Bettelmann musste selber mit Hand anlegen, dass es noch so leidlich gieng. Als sie die schmale Kost verzehrt hatten, legten sie sich zu Bett, aber am Morgen trieb er sie schon ganz früh heraus, weil sie das Haus besorgen sollte. Ein paar Tage lebten sie auf diese Art schlecht und recht, und zehrten ihren Vorrat auf. Da sprach der Mann „Frau, so gehts nicht länger, dass wir hier zehren und nichts verdienen. Du sollst Körbe flechten.“ Er gieng aus, schnitt Weiden, und brachte sie heim. Da fieng sie an zu flechten, aber die harten Weiden stachen ihr die zarten Hände wund. „Ich sehe das geht nicht,“ sprach der Mann, „spinn lieber, vielleicht kannst du das besser.“ Sie setzte sich hin, und versuchte zu spinnen, aber der harte Faden schnitt ihr bald in die weichen Finger, dass das Blut daran herunter lief. „Siehst du,“ sprach der Mann, „du taugst zu keiner Arbeit, mit dir bin ich schlimm angekommen. Nun will ichs versuchen, und einen Handel mit Töpfen und irdenem Geschirr anfangen. Du sollst dich auf den Markt setzen, und die Waare feil halten.“ „Ach,“ dachte sie, „wenn auf den Markt Leute aus meines Vaters Reich kommen, und sehen mich da sitzen und feil halten, wie werden sie mich verspotten!“ Aber es half nichts, sie musste sich fügen, wenn sie nicht Hungers sterben wollten. Das erstemal gings gut, denn die Leute kauften der Frau, weil sie schön war, gern ihre Waare ab, und bezahlten was sie forderte. Ja, viele gaben ihr das Geld, und liessen ihr die Töpfe noch dazu. Nun lebten sie von dem erworbenen so lang es dauerte, da handelte der Mann wieder eine Menge neues Geschirr ein. Sie setzte sich damit an eine Ecke des Marktes, und stellte es um sich her, und hielt feil. Da kam plötzlich ein trunkener Husar daher gejagt, und ritt gerade zu in die Töpfe hinein, dass alles in tausend Scherben zersprang. Sie fieng an zu weinen und wusste vor Angst nicht was sie anfangen sollte. „Ach, wie wird mirs ergehen!“ rief sie, „was wird mein Mann dazu sagen!“ Sie lief heim und erzählte ihm das Unglück. „Wer setzt sich auch an die Ecke des Marktes mit irdenem Geschirr!“ sprach der Mann, „lass nur das Weinen, ich sehe wohl du bist zu keiner ordentlichen Arbeit zu gebrauchen. Da bin ich in unseres Königs Schloss gewesen und habe gefragt ob sie nicht eine Küchenmagd brauchen könnten, und sie haben mir versprochen sie wollten dich dazu nehmen; dafür bekommst du freies Essen.“\n\nNun ward die Königstochter eine Küchenmagd, musste dem Koch zur Hand gehen und die sauerste Arbeit tun. Sie machte sich in beiden Taschen ein Töpfchen fest, darin brachte sie nach Haus was ihr von dem übrig gebliebenen zu Teil ward, und davon nährten sie sich. Es trug sich zu, dass die Hochzeit des ältesten Königssohnes sollte gefeiert werden, da gieng die arme Frau hinauf, stellte sich vor die Saaltüre und wollte zusehen. Als nun die Lichter angezündet waren, und immer einer schöner als der andere hereintrat, und alles voll Pracht und Herrlichkeit war, da dachte sie mit betrübtem Herzen an ihr Schicksal, und verwünschte ihren Stolz und Übermut, der sie erniedrigt und in so grosse Armut gestürzt hatte. Von den köstlichen Speisen, die da ein und ausgetragen wurden, und von welchen der Geruch zu ihr aufstieg, warfen ihr Diener manchmal ein paar Brocken zu, die tat sie in ihr Töpfchen, und wollte es heim tragen. Auf einmal trat der Königssohn herein, war in Sammt und Seide gekleidet und hatte goldene Ketten um den Hals. Und als er die schöne Frau in der Türe stehen sah, ergriff er sie bei der Hand, und wollte mit ihr tanzen, aber sie weigerte sich und erschrack, denn sie sah dass es der König Drosselbart war, der um sie gefreit und den sie mit Spott abgewiesen hatte. Ihr Sträuben half nichts, er zog sie in den Saal. Da zerriss das Band, an welchem die Taschen hiengen, und die Töpfe fielen heraus, dass die Suppe floss und die Brocken umher sprangen. Und wie das die Leute sahen, entstand ein allgemeines Gelächter und Spotten, und sie war so beschämt, dass sie sich lieber tausend Klafter unter die Erde gewünscht hätte. Sie sprang zur Türe hinaus und wollte entfliehen, aber auf der Treppe holte sie ein Mann ein, und brachte sie zurück und wie sie ihn ansah, war es wieder der König Drosselbart. Er sprach ihr freundlich zu, „fürchte dich nicht, ich und der Spielmann, der mit dir in dem elenden Häuschen gewohnt hat, sind eins. Dir zu Liebe habe ich mich so verstellt, und der Husar, der dir die Töpfe entzwei geritten hat, bin ich auch gewesen. Das alles ist geschehen, um deinen stolzen Sinn zu beugen, und dich für deinen Hochmut zu strafen, womit du mich verspottet hast.“ Da weinte sie bitterlich und sagte „ich habe grosses Unrecht gehabt und bin nicht wert deine Frau zu sein.“ Er aber sprach „tröste dich, die bösen Tage sind vorüber, jetzt wollen wir unsere Hochzeit feiern.“ Da kamen die Kammerfrauen und taten ihr die prächtigsten Kleider an, und ihr Vater kam und der ganze Hof, und wünschten ihr Glück zu ihrer Vermählung mit dem König Drosselbart, und die rechte Freude fieng jetzt erst an. Ich wollte, du und ich, wir wären auch dabei gewesen."

        "text": "Jorinde und Joringel.\n\nEs war einmal ein altes Schloss mitten in einem grossen dicken Wald, darinnen wohnte eine alte Frau ganz allein. Sie war eine Erzzauberin. Am Tage machte sie sich zur Katze oder zur Nachteule, des Abends aber wurde sie wieder ordentlich wie ein Mensch gestaltet. Sie konnte das Wild und die Vögel herbei locken, und dann schlachtete sie, kochte und briet es. Wenn Jemand auf hundert Schritte dem Schloss nahe kam, so musste er stille stehen und konnte sich nicht von der Stelle bewegen, bis sie ihn los sprach. Wenn aber eine keusche Jungfrau in diesen Kreiss kam, so verwandelte sie dieselbe in einen Vogel, und sperrte sie dann in einen Korb ein, und trug den Korb in eine Kammer des Schlosses. Sie hatte wohl sieben tausend solcher Körbe mit so raren Vögeln im Schlosse.\n\nNun war einmal eine Jungfrau, die hiess Jorinde. Sie war schöner als alle andere Mädchen. Die, und dann ein gar schöner Jüngling, Namens Joringel, hatten sich zusammen versprochen. Sie waren in den Brauttagen und sie hatten ihr grösstes Vergnügen eins am andern. Damit sie nun einsmalen vertraut zusammen reden könnten, giengen sie in den Wald spazieren. „Hüte dich,“ sagte Joringel, „dass du nicht so nahe ans Schloss kommst.“ Es war ein schöner Abend, die Sonne schien zwischen den Stämmen der Bäume hell ins dunkle Grün des Waldes, und die Turteltaube sang kläglich auf den alten Maibuchen.\n\nJorinde weinte zuweilen, setzte sich hin im Sonnenschein und klagte; Joringel klagte auch. Sie waren so bestürzt, als wenn sie hätten sterben sollen. Sie sahen sich um, waren irre und wussten nicht wohin sie nach Hause gehen sollten. Noch halb stand die Sonne über dem Berg und halb war sie unter. Joringel sah durchs Gebüsch und sah die alte Mauer des Schlosses nah bei sich; er erschrack und wurde todtbang. Jorinde sang\n\n„mein Vöglein mit dem Ringlein rot\nsingt Leide, Leide, Leide.\nEs singt dem Täubelein seinen Tod,\nsingt Leide, Lei– zucküth, zicküth, zicküth.“\n\nJoringel sah nach Jorinde. Jorinde war in eine Nachtigall verwandelt, die sang „zicküth, zicküth.“ Eine Nachteule mit glühenden Augen flog dreimal um sie herum und schrie dreimal „schu, hu, hu, hu.“ Joringel konnte sich nicht regen. Er stand da wie ein Stein, konnte nicht weinen, nicht reden, nicht Hand noch Fuss regen. Nun war die Sonne unter, die Eule flog in einen Strauch, und gleich darauf kam eine alte krumme Frau aus diesem hervor, gelb und mager, grosse rote Augen, krumme Nase, die mit der Spitze ans Kinn reichte. Sie murmelte, fieng die Nachtigall und trug sie auf der Hand fort. Joringel konnte nichts sagen, nicht von der Stelle kommen; die Nachtigall war fort. Endlich kam das Weib wieder und sagte mit dumpfer Stimme „grüss dich, Zachiel, wenns Möndel ins Körbel scheint, bind los, Zachiel, zu guter Stund.“ Da wurde Joringel los. Er fiel vor dem Weib auf die Knie und bat sie möchte ihm seine Jorinde wieder geben, aber sie sagte er sollte sie nie wieder haben, und gieng fort. Er rief, er weinte, er jammerte, aber alles umsonst. „Uu, was soll mir geschehen?“ Joringel gieng fort und kam endlich in ein fremdes Dorf. Da hütete er die Schafe lange Zeit. Oft gieng er rund um das Schloss herum, aber nicht zu nahe dabei. Endlich träumte er einmal des Nachts er fände eine blutrote Blume, in deren Mitte eine schöne grosse Perle war. Die Blume brach er ab, gieng damit zum Schlosse. Alles, was er mit der Blume berührte, ward von der Zauberei frei. Auch träumte er, er hätte seine Jorinde dadurch wieder bekommen. Des Morgens, als er erwachte, fieng er an durch Berg und Tal zu suchen ob er eine solche Blume fände. Er suchte bis an den neunten Tag, da fand er die blutrote Blume am Morgen früh. In der Mitte war ein grosser Tautropfe, so gross wie die schönste Perle. Diese Blume trug er Tag und Nacht bis zum Schloss. Wie er auf hundert Schritt nahe bis zum Schloss kam, da ward er nicht fest, sondern gieng fort bis ans Tor. Joringel freute sich hoch, berührte die Pforte mit der Blume, und sie sprang auf. Er gieng hinein, durch den Hof, horchte wo er die vielen Vögel vernähme. Endlich hörte ers. Er gieng und fand den Saal, darauf war die Zauberin und fütterte die Vögel in den sieben tausend Körben. Wie sie den Joringel sah, ward sie bös, sehr bös, schalt, spie Gift und Galle gegen ihn aus, aber sie konnte auf zwei Schritte nicht an ihn kommen. Er kehrte sich nicht an sie und gieng, besah die Körbe mit den Vögeln; da waren aber viele hundert Nachtigallen, wie sollte er nun seine Jorinde wieder finden? Indem er so zusah, dass die Alte heimlich ein Körbchen mit einem Vogel wegnahm und damit nach der Türe gieng. Flugs sprang er hinzu, berührte das Körbchen mit der Blume und auch das alte Weib. Nun konnte sie nichts mehr zaubern, und Jorinde stand da, hatte ihn um den Hals gefasst, so schön wie sie ehemals war. Da machte er auch alle die andern Vögel wieder zu Jungfrauen, und da gieng er mit seiner Jorinde nach Hause, und sie lebten lange vergnügt zusammen."

        "text": "Die goldene Gans.\n\nEs war ein Mann, der hatte drei Söhne, davon hiess der jüngste der Dummling, und wurde verachtet und verspottet, und bei jeder Gelegenheit zurückgesetzt. Es geschah, dass der älteste in den Wald gehen wollte, Holz hauen, und eh er gieng, gab ihm noch seine Mutter einen schönen feinen Eierkuchen und eine Flasche Wein mit, damit er nicht Hunger und Durst litte. Als er in den Wald kam, begegnete ihm ein altes graues Männlein, das bot ihm einen guten Tag und sprach „gieb mir doch ein Stück Kuchen aus deiner Tasche, und lass mich einen Schluck von deinem Wein trinken, ich bin so hungrig und durstig.“ Der kluge Sohn aber antwortete „geb ich dir meinen Kuchen und meinen Wein, so hab ich selber nichts, pack dich deiner Wege,“ liess das Männlein stehen und gieng fort. Als er nun anfieng einen Baum zu behauen, dauerte es nicht lange, so hieb er fehl, und die Axt fuhr ihm in den Arm, dass er musste heimgehen und sich verbinden lassen. Das war aber von dem grauen Männchen gekommen.\n\nDarauf gieng der zweite Sohn in den Wald, und die Mutter gab ihm, wie dem ältesten, einen Eierkuchen und eine Flasche Wein. Dem begegnete gleichfalls das alte graue Männchen und hielt um ein Stückchen Kuchen und einen Trunk Wein an. Aber der zweite Sohn sprach auch ganz verständig „was ich dir gebe, das geht mir selber ab, pack dich deiner Wege,“ liess das Männlein stehen und gieng fort. Die Strafe blieb nicht aus, als er ein paar Hiebe am Baum getan, hieb er sich ins Bein, dass er musste nach Haus getragen werden.\n\nDa sagte der Dummling „Vater, lass mich einmal hinaus gehen und Holz hauen.“ Antwortete der Vater „deine Brüder haben sich Schaden dabei getan, lass dich davon, du verstehst nichts davon.“ Der Dummling aber bat so lange, bis er endlich sagte „geh nur hin, durch Schaden wirst du klug werden.“ Die Mutter gab ihm einen Kuchen, der war mit Wasser in der Asche gebacken, und dazu eine Flasche saueres Bier. Als er in den Wald kam, begegnete ihm gleichfalls das alte graue Männchen, grüsste ihn und sprach „gieb mir ein Stück von deinem Kuchen und einen Trunk aus deiner Flasche, ich bin so hungrig und durstig.“ Antwortete der Dummling „ich habe aber nur Aschenkuchen und saueres Bier, wenn dir das recht ist, so wollen wir uns setzen und essen.“ Da setzten sie sich, und als der Dummling seinen Aschenkuchen herausholte, so wars ein feiner Eierkuchen, und das sauere Bier war ein guter Wein. Nun assen und tranken sie, und danach sprach das Männlein „weil du ein gutes Herz hast und von dem Deinigen gerne mitteilst, so will ich dir Glück bescheren. Dort steht ein alter Baum, den hau ab, so wirst du in den Wurzeln etwas finden.“ Darauf nahm das Männlein Abschied.\n\nDer Dummling gieng hin und hieb den Baum um, und wie er fiel, sass in den Wurzeln eine Gans, die hatte Federn von reinem Gold. Er hob sie heraus, nahm sie mit sich und gieng in ein Wirtshaus, da wollte er übernachten. Der Wirt hatte aber drei Töchter, die sahen die Gans, waren neugierig was das für ein wunderlicher Vogel wäre und hätten gar gern eine von seinen goldenen Federn gehabt. Die älteste dachte „es wird sich schon eine Gelegenheit finden wo ich mir eine Feder ausziehen kann,“ und als der Dummling einmal hinaus gegangen war, fasste sie die Gans beim Flügel, aber Finger und Hand blieben ihr daran festhängen. Bald danach kam die zweite und hatte keinen andern Gedanken als sich eine goldene Feder zu holen. Kaum aber hatte sie ihre Schwester angerührt, so blieb sie festhängen. Endlich kam auch die dritte in gleicher Absicht. Da schrieen die andern „bleib weg, ums Himmelswillen, bleib weg.“ Aber sie begriff nicht warum sie wegbleiben sollte, dachte „sind die dabei, so kann ich auch dabei sein,“ und sprang herzu, und wie sie ihre Schwester angerührt hatte, so blieb sie an ihr hängen. So mussten sie die Nacht bei der Gans zubringen.\n\nAm andern Morgen nahm der Dummling die Gans in den Arm, gieng fort, und bekümmerte sich nicht um die drei Mädchen, die daran hiengen. Sie mussten immer hinter ihm drein laufen, links und rechts, wies ihm in die Beine kam. Mitten auf dem Felde begegnete ihnen der Pfarrer, und als er den Aufzug sah, sprach er „schämt euch, ihr garstigen Mädchen, was lauft ihr dem jungen Bursch durchs Feld nach, schickt sich das?“ Damit fasste er die jüngste an die Hand und wollte sie zurückziehen. Wie er sie aber anrührte, blieb er gleichfalls hängen und musste selber hinter drein laufen. Nicht lange, so kam der Küster daher, und sah den Herrn Pfarrer, der drei Mädchen auf dem Fuss folgte. Da verwunderte er sich und rief „ei, Herr Pfarrer, wo hinaus so geschwind? vergesst nicht dass wir heute noch eine Kindtaufe haben,“ lief auf ihn zu und fasste ihn am Ermel, blieb aber auch fest hängen. Wie die fünf so hinter einander her trabten, kamen zwei Bauern mit ihren Hacken vom Feld. Da rief der Pfarrer sie an und bat sie möchten ihn und den Küster los machen. Kaum aber hatten sie den Küster angerührt, so blieben sie hängen, und waren ihrer nun siebene, die dem Dummling mit der Gans nachliefen.\n\nEr kam darauf in eine Stadt, da herrschte ein König, der hatte eine Tochter, die war so ernsthaft, dass sie niemand zum lachen bringen konnte. Darum hatte er ein Gesetz gegeben, wer sie könnte zum lachen bringen, der sollte sie heiraten. Der Dummling, als er das hörte, gieng mit seiner Gans und ihrem Anhang vor die Königstochter, und als diese die sieben Menschen immer hinter einander herlaufen sah, fieng sie überlaut an zu lachen und wollte gar nicht wieder aufhören. Da verlangte sie der Dummling zur Braut, aber dem König gefiel der Schwiegersohn nicht, er machte allerlei Einwendungen und sagte er müsste ihm erst einen Mann bringen, der einen Keller voll Wein austrinken könnte. Der Dummling dachte an das graue Männchen, das könnte ihm wohl helfen, gieng hinaus in den Wald, und auf der Stelle, wo er den Baum abgehauen hatte, sah er einen Mann sitzen, der machte ein ganz betrübtes Gesicht. Der Dummling fragte was er sich so sehr zu Herzen nähme. Da antwortete er „ich habe so grossen Durst, und kann ihn nicht löschen, das kalte Wasser vertrage ich nicht, ein Fass Wein habe ich zwar ausgeleert, aber was ist ein Tropfen auf einem heissen Stein?“ „Da kann ich dir helfen,“ sagte der Dummling, „komm nur mit mir, du sollst satt haben.“ Er führte ihn darauf in des Königs Keller, und der Mann machte sich über die grossen Fässer, trank und trank, dass ihm die Hüften weh taten, und ehe ein Tag herum war, hatte er den ganzen Keller ausgetrunken. Der Dummling verlangte abermals seine Braut, der König aber ärgerte sich dass ein schlechter Bursch, den jedermann einen Dummling nannte, seine Tochter davon tragen sollte, und machte neue Bedingungen. Er müsste erst einen Mann schaffen, der einen Berg voll Brot aufessen könnte. Der Dummling besann sich nicht lange, sondern gieng gleich hinaus in den Wald. Da sass auf demselben Platz ein Mann, der schnürte sich den Leib mit einem Riemen zusammen, machte ein grämliches Gesicht, und sagte „ich habe einen ganzen Backofen voll Raspelbrot gegessen, aber was hilft das, wenn man so grossen Hunger hat, wie ich. Mein Magen bleibt leer, und ich muss mich nur zuschnüren, wenn ich nicht Hungers sterben soll.“ Der Dummling war froh darüber, und sprach „mach dich auf und geh mit mir, du sollst dich satt essen.“ Er führte ihn an den Hof des Königs, der hatte alles Mehl aus dem ganzen Reich zusammenfahren und einen ungeheuern Berg davon backen lassen. Der Mann aus dem Walde stellte sich davor, fieng an zu essen, und in einem Tag war der ganze Berg verschwunden. Der Dummling forderte zum drittenmal seine Braut, der König aber suchte noch einmal Ausflucht, und verlangte ein Schiff das zu Land und zu Wasser fahren könnte: „so wie du aber damit angesegelt kommst,“ sagte er, „so sollst du gleich meine Tochter zur Gemahlin haben.“ Der Dummling gieng gerades Weges in den Wald, da sass das alte graue Männchen, dem er seinen Kuchen gegeben hatte, und sagte „ich habe für dich getrunken und gegessen, ich will dir auch das Schiff geben; das alles tu ich, weil du barmherzig gegen mich gewesen bist.“ Da gab er ihm das Schiff, das zu Land und zu Wasser fuhr, und als der König das sah, konnte er ihm seine Tochter nicht länger vorenthalten. Die Hochzeit ward gefeiert, nach des Königs Tod erbte der Dummling das Reich, und lebte lange Zeit vergnügt mit seiner Gemahlin."

        "text": "Hänsel und Grethel.\n\nVor einem grossen Walde wohnte ein armer Holzhacker mit seiner Frau und seinen zwei Kindern; das Bübchen hiess Hänsel und das Mädchen Grethel. Er hatte wenig zu beissen und zu brechen, und einmal, als grosse Teuerung ins Land kam, konnte er auch das täglich Brot nicht mehr schaffen. Wie er sich nun Abends im Bette Gedanken machte und sich vor Sorgen herum wälzte, seufzte er und sprach zu seiner Frau „was soll aus uns werden? wie können wir unsere armen Kinder ernähren, da wir für uns selbst nichts mehr haben?“ „Weisst du was, Mann,“ antwortete die Frau, „wir wollen Morgen in aller Frühe die Kinder hinaus in den Wald führen, wo er am dicksten ist. Da machen wir ihnen ein Feuer an und geben jedem noch ein Stückchen Brot, dann gehen wir an unsere Arbeit und lassen sie allein. Sie finden den Weg nicht wieder nach Haus und wir sind sie los.“ „Nein, Frau,“ sagte der Mann, „das tue ich nicht; wie sollt ichs übers Herz bringen meine Kinder im Walde allein zu lassen, die wilden Tiere würden bald kommen und sie zerreissen.“ „O du Narr,“ sagte sie, „dann müssen wir alle viere Hungers sterben, du kannst nur die Bretter für die Särge hobelen,“ und liess ihm keine Ruhe bis er einwilligte. „Aber die armen Kinder dauern mich doch“ sagte der Mann.\n\nDie zwei Kinder hatten vor Hunger auch nicht einschlafen können und hatten gehört was die Stiefmutter zum Vater gesagt hatte. Grethel weinte bittere Tränen und sprach zu Hänsel „nun ists um uns geschehen.“ „Still, Grethel,“ sprach Hänsel, „gräme dich nicht, ich will uns schon helfen.“ Und als die Alten eingeschlafen waren, stand er auf, zog sein Röcklein an, machte die Untertüre auf und schlich sich hinaus. Da schien der Mond ganz helle, und die weissen Kieselsteine, die vor dem Haus lagen, glänzten wie lauter Batzen. Hänsel bückte sich und steckte so viel in sein Rocktäschlein, als nur hinein wollten. Dann gieng er wieder zurück, sprach zu Grethel „sei getrost, liebes Schwesterchen und schlaf nur ruhig ein, Gott wird uns nicht verlassen,“ und legte sich wieder in sein Bett.\n\nAls der Tag anbrach, noch ehe die Sonne aufgegangen war, kam schon die Frau und weckte die beiden Kinder, „steht auf, ihr Faullenzer, wir wollen in den Wald gehen und Holz holen.“ Dann gab sie jedem ein Stückchen Brot und sprach „da habt ihr etwas für den Mittag, aber essts nicht vorher auf, weiter kriegt ihr nichts.“ Grethel nahm das Brot unter die Schürze, weil Hänsel die Steine in der Tasche hatte. Danach machten sie sich alle zusammen auf den Weg nach dem Wald. Als sie ein Weilchen gegangen waren, stand Hänsel still und guckte nach dem Haus zurück und tat das wieder und immer wieder. Der Vater sprach „Hänsel, was guckst du da und bleibst zurück, hab Acht und vergiss deine Beine nicht.“ „Ach, Vater,“ sagte Hänsel, „ich sehe nach meinem weissen Kätzchen, das sitzt oben auf dem Dach und will mir Ade sagen.“ Die Frau sprach „Narr, das ist dein Kätzchen nicht, das ist die Morgensonne, die auf den Schornstein scheint.“ Hänsel aber hatte nicht nach dem Kätzchen gesehen, sondern immer einen von den blanken Kieselsteinen aus seiner Tasche auf den Weg geworfen.\n\nAls sie mitten in den Wald gekommen waren, sprach der Vater „nun sammelt Holz, ihr Kinder, ich will ein Feuer anmachen, damit ihr nicht friert.“ Hänsel und Grethel trugen Reisig zusammen, einen kleinen Berg hoch. Das Reisig ward angezündet, und als die Flamme recht hoch brannte, sagte die Frau „nun legt euch ans Feuer, ihr Kinder und ruht euch aus, wir gehen in den Wald und hauen Holz. Wenn wir fertig sind, kommen wir wieder und holen euch ab.“\n\nHänsel und Grethel sassen am Feuer, und als der Mittag kam, ass jedes sein Stücklein Brot. Und weil sie die Schläge der Holzaxt hörten, so glaubten sie ihr Vater wäre in der Nähe. Es war aber nicht die Holzaxt, es war ein Ast, den er an einen dürren Baum gebunden hatte und den der Wind hin und her schlug. Und als sie so lange gesessen hatten, fielen ihnen die Augen vor Müdigkeit zu, und sie schliefen fest ein. Als sie endlich erwachten, war es schon finstere Nacht. Grethel fieng an zu weinen und sprach „wie sollen wir nun aus dem Wald kommen!“ Hänsel aber tröstete sie, „wart nur ein Weilchen, bis der Mond aufgegangen ist, dann wollen wir den Weg schon finden.“ Und als der volle Mond aufgestiegen war, so nahm Hänsel sein Schwesterchen an der Hand und gieng den Kieselsteinen nach, die schimmerten wie neu geschlagene Batzen und zeigten ihnen den Weg. Sie giengen die ganze Nacht hindurch und kamen bei anbrechendem Tag wieder zu ihres Vaters Haus. Sie klopften an die Tür, und als die Frau aufmachte und sah dass es Hänsel und Grethel war, sprach sie „ihr bösen Kinder, was habt ihr so lange im Walde geschlafen, wir haben geglaubt ihr wolltet gar nicht wieder kommen.“ Der Vater aber freute sich, denn es war ihm zu Herzen gegangen dass er sie so allein zurück gelassen hatte.\n\nNicht lange danach war wieder Not in allen Ecken, und die Kinder hörten wie die Mutter Nachts im Bette zu dem Vater sprach „alles ist wieder aufgezehrt, wir haben noch einen halben Laib Brot, hernach hat das Lied ein Ende. Die Kinder müssen fort, wir wollen sie tiefer in den Wald hineinführen, damit sie den Weg nicht wieder heraus finden; es ist sonst keine Rettung für uns.“ Dem Mann fiels schwer aufs Herz und er dachte „es wäre besser, dass du den letzten Bissen mit deinen Kindern theiltest.“ Aber die Frau hörte auf nichts, was er sagte, schalt ihn und machte ihm Vorwürfe. Wer A sagt muss auch B sagen, und weil er das erste Mal nachgegeben hatte, so musste er es auch zum zweiten Mal.\n\nDie Kinder waren aber noch wach gewesen und hatten das Gespräch mit angehört. Als die Alten schliefen, stand Hänsel wieder auf, wollte hinaus und Kieselsteine auflesen, wie das vorigemal, aber die Frau hatte die Tür verschlossen, und Hänsel konnte nicht heraus. Aber er tröstete sein Schwesterchen und sprach „weine nicht, Grethel, und schlaf nur ruhig, der liebe Gott wird uns schon helfen.“\n\nAm frühen Morgen kam die Frau und holte die Kinder aus dem Bette. Sie erhielten ihr Stückchen Brot, das war aber noch kleiner als das vorigemal. Auf dem Wege nach dem Wald bröckelte es Hänsel in der Tasche, stand oft still und warf ein Bröcklein auf die Erde. „Hänsel, was stehst du und guckst dich um,“ sagte der Vater, „geh deiner Wege.“ „Ich sehe nach meinem Täubchen, das sitzt auf dem Dache und will mir Ade sagen,“ antwortete Hänsel. „Narr,“ sagte die Frau, „das ist dein Täubchen nicht, das ist die Morgensonne, die auf den Schornstein oben scheint.“ Hänsel aber warf nach und nach alle Bröcklein auf den Weg.\n\nDie Frau führte die Kinder noch tiefer in den Wald, wo sie ihr Lebtag noch nicht gewesen waren. Da ward wieder ein grosses Feuer angemacht, und die Mutter sagte „bleibt nur da sitzen, ihr Kinder, und wenn ihr müde seid, könnt ihr ein wenig schlafen. Wir gehen in den Wald und hauen Holz, und Abends, wenn wir fertig sind, kommen wir und holen euch ab.“ Als es Mittag war, teilte Grethel ihr Brot mit Hänsel, der sein Stück auf den Weg gestreut hatte. Dann schliefen sie ein, und der Abend vergieng, aber niemand kam zu den armen Kindern. Sie erwachten erst in der finstern Nacht, und Hänsel tröstete sein Schwesterchen und sagte, „wart nur, Grethel, bis der Mond aufgeht, dann werden wir die Brotbröcklein sehen, die ich ausgestreut habe, die zeigen uns den Weg nach Haus.“ Als der Mond kam, machten sie sich auf, aber sie fanden kein Bröcklein mehr, denn die viel tausend Vögel, die im Walde und im Felde umher fliegen, die hatten sie weggepickt. Hänsel sagte zu Grethel „wir werden den Weg schon finden,“ aber sie fanden ihn nicht. Sie giengen die ganze Nacht und noch einen Tag von Morgen bis Abend, aber sie kamen aus dem Wald nicht heraus, und waren so hungrig, denn sie hatten nichts als die paar Beeren, die auf der Erde standen. Und weil sie so müde waren dass die Beine sie nicht mehr tragen wollten, so legten sie sich unter einen Baum und schliefen ein.\n\nNun wars schon der dritte Morgen, dass sie ihres Vaters Haus verlassen hatten. Sie fiengen wieder an zu gehen, aber sie gerieten immer tiefer in den Wald und wenn nicht bald Hilfe kam, so mussten sie verschmachten. Als es Mittag war, sahen sie ein schönes schneeweisses Vöglein auf einem Ast sitzen, das sang so schön, dass sie stehen blieben und ihm zuhörten. Und als es fertig war, schwang es seine Flügel und flog vor ihnen her, und sie giengen ihm nach, bis sie zu einem Häuschen gelangten, auf dessen Dach es sich setzte, und als sie ganz nah heran kamen, so sahen sie dass das Häuslein aus Brot gebaut war, und mit Kuchen gedeckt; aber die Fenster waren von hellem Zucker. „Da wollen wir uns dran machen,“ sprach Hänsel, „und eine gesegnete Mahlzeit halten. Ich will ein Stück vom Dach essen, Grethel, du kannst vom Fenster essen, das schmeckt süss.“ Hänsel reichte in die Höhe und brach sich ein wenig vom Dach ab, um zu versuchen wie es schmeckte, und Grethel stellte sich an die Scheiben und knuperte daran. Da rief eine feine Stimme aus der Stube heraus\n\n„knuper, knuper, kneischen,\nwer knupert an meinem Häuschen?“\n\ndie Kinder antworteten\n\n„der Wind, der Wind,\ndas himmlische Kind,“\n\nund assen weiter, ohne sich irre machen zu lassen. Hänsel, dem das Dach sehr gut schmeckte, riss sich ein grosses Stück davon herunter, und Grethel stiess eine ganze runde Fensterscheibe heraus, setzte sich nieder, und tat sich wohl damit. Da gieng auf einmal die Türe auf, und eine steinalte Frau, die sich auf eine Krücke stützte, kam heraus geschlichen. Hänsel und Grethel erschracken so gewaltig, dass sie fallen liessen was sie in den Händen hielten. Die Alte aber wackelte mit dem Kopfe und sprach „ei, ihr lieben Kinder, wer hat euch hierher gebracht? kommt nur herein und bleibt bei mir, es geschieht euch kein Leid.“ Sie fasste beide an der Hand und führte sie in ihr Häuschen. Da ward gutes Essen aufgetragen, Milch und Pfannekuchen mit Zucker, Äpfel und Nüsse. Hernach wurden zwei schöne Bettlein weiss gedeckt, und Hänsel und Grethel legten sich hinein und meinten sie wären im Himmel.\n\nDie Alte hatte sich nur so freundlich angestellt, sie war aber eine böse Hexe, die den Kindern auflauerte, und hatte das Brothäuslein bloss gebaut, um sie herbeizulocken. Wenn eins in ihre Gewalt kam, so machte sie es todt, kochte es und ass es, und das war ihr ein Festtag. Die Hexen haben rote Augen und können nicht weit sehen, aber sie haben eine feine Witterung, wie die Tiere, und merkens wenn Menschen heran kommen. Als Hänsel und Grethel in ihre Nähe kamen, da lachte sie boshaft und sprach höhnisch „die habe ich, die sollen mir nicht wieder entwischen.“ Früh Morgens ehe die Kinder erwacht waren, stand sie schon auf, und als sie beide so lieblich ruhen sah, mit den vollen roten Backen, so murmelte sie vor sich hin „das wird ein guter Bissen werden.“ Da packte sie Hänsel mit ihrer dürren Hand und trug ihn in einen kleinen Stall und sperrte ihn mit einer Gittertüre ein; er mochte schreien wie er wollte, es half ihm nichts. Dann gieng sie zur Grethel, rüttelte sie wach und rief „steh auf, Faullenzerin, trag Wasser und koch deinem Bruder etwas gutes, der sitzt draussen im Stall und soll fett werden. Wenn er fett ist, so will ich ihn essen.“ Grethel fieng an bitterlich zu weinen, aber es war alles vergeblich, sie musste tun was die böse Hexe verlangte.\n\nNun ward dem armen Hänsel das beste Essen gekocht, aber Grethel bekam nichts als Krebsschalen. Jeden Morgen schlich die Alte zu dem Ställchen und rief „Hänsel, streck deine Finger heraus, damit ich fühle ob du bald fett bist.“ Hänsel streckte ihr aber ein Knöchlein heraus, und die Alte, die trübe Augen hatte, konnte es nicht sehen, und meinte es wären Hänsels Finger, und verwunderte sich dass er gar nicht fett werden wollte. Als vier Wochen herum waren und Hänsel immer mager blieb, da übernahm sie die Ungeduld, und sie wollte nicht länger warten. „Heda, Grethel,“ rief sie dem Mädchen zu, „sei flink und trag Wasser. Hänsel mag fett oder mager sein, morgen will ich ihn schlachten und kochen.“ Ach, wie jammerte das arme Schwesterchen, als es das Wasser tragen musste, und wie flossen ihm die Tränen über die Backen herunter! „Lieber Gott, hilf uns doch,“ rief sie aus, „hätten uns nur die wilden Tiere im Wald gefressen, so wären wir doch zusammen gestorben.“ „Spar nur dein Geblärre,“ sagte die Alte, „es hilft dir alles nichts.“\n\nFrüh Morgens musste Grethel heraus, den Kessel mit Wasser aufhängen und Feuer anzünden. „Erst wollen wir backen“ sagte die Alte, „ich habe den Backofen schon eingeheizt und den Teig geknätet.“ Sie stiess das arme Grethel hinaus zu dem Backofen, aus dem die Feuerflammen schon heraus schlugen. „Kriech hinein,“ sagte die Hexe, „und sieh zu ob recht eingeheizt ist, damit wir das Brot hineinschieben können.“ Und wenn Grethel darin war, wollte sie den Ofen zumachen, und Grethel sollte darin braten, und dann wollte sies auch aufessen. Aber Grethel merkte was sie im Sinn hatte und sprach „ich weiss nicht wie ichs machen soll; wie komm ich da hinein?“ „Dumme Gans,“ sagte die Alte, „die Öffnung ist gross genug, siehst du wohl, ich könnte selbst hinein,“ krappelte heran und steckte den Kopf in den Backofen. Da gab ihr Grethel einen Stoss dass sie weit hinein fuhr, machte die eiserne Tür zu und schob den Riegel vor. Hu! da fieng sie an zu heulen, ganz grauselich; aber Grethel lief fort, und die gottlose Hexe musste elendiglich verbrennen.\n\nGrethel aber lief schnurstracks zum Hänsel, öffnete sein Ställchen und rief „Hänsel, wir sind erlöst, die alte Hexe ist todt.“ Da sprang Hänsel heraus, wie ein Vogel aus dem Käfig, wenn ihm die Türe aufgemacht wird. Wie haben sie sich gefreut, sind sich um den Hals gefallen, sind herumgesprungen und haben sich geküsst! Und weil sie sich nicht mehr zu fürchten brauchten, so giengen sie in das Haus der Hexe hinein, da standen in allen Ecken Kasten mit Perlen und Edelsteinen. „Die sind noch besser als Kieselsteine“ sagte Hänsel und steckte in seine Taschen was hinein wollte, und Grethel sagte „ich will auch etwas mit nach Haus bringen“ und füllte sich sein Schürzchen voll. „Aber jetzt wollen wir fort,“ sagte Hänsel, „damit wir aus dem Hexenwald herauskommen.“ Als sie aber ein paar Stunden gegangen waren, gelangten sie an ein grosses Wasser. „Wir können nicht hinüber,“ sprach Hänsel, „ich sehe keinen Steg und keine Brücke.“ „Hier fährt auch kein Schiffchen,“ antwortete Grethel, „aber da schwimmt eine weisse Ente, wenn ich die bitte, so hilft sie uns hinüber.“ Da rief sie\n\n\n„Entchen, Entchen,\nda steht Grethel und Hänsel.\nKein Steg und keine Brücke,\nnimm uns auf deinen weissen Rücken.“\n\nDas Entchen kam auch heran, und Hänsel setzte sich auf und bat sein Schwesterchen sich zu ihm zu setzen. „Nein,“ antwortete Grethel, „es wird dem Entchen zu schwer, es soll uns nach einander hinüber bringen.“ Das tat das gute Tierchen, und als sie glücklich drüben waren und ein Weilchen fortgiengen, da kam ihnen der Wald immer bekannter und immer bekannter vor, und endlich erblickten sie von weitem ihres Vaters Haus. Da fiengen sie an zu laufen, stürzten in die Stube hinein und fielen ihrem Vater um den Hals. Der Mann hatte keine frohe Stunde gehabt, seitdem er die Kinder im Walde gelassen hatte, die Frau aber war gestorben. Grethel schüttete sein Schürzchen aus dass die Perlen und Edelsteine in der Stube herumsprangen, und Hänsel warf eine Handvoll nach der andern aus seiner Tasche dazu. Da hatten alle Sorgen ein Ende, und sie lebten in lauter Freude zusammen."

        "text": "Die sieben Raben.\n\nEs war einmal ein Mann, der hatte sieben Söhne und immer noch kein Töchterchen, so sehr er sichs auch wünschte; endlich gab ihm seine Frau wieder gute Hoffnung zu einem Kinde, und wies zur Welt kam, wars auch ein Mädchen. Die Freude war gross, aber das Kind war schmächtig und klein, und sollte wegen seiner Schwachheit die Nottaufe haben. Der Vater schickte einen der Knaben eilends zur Quelle, Taufwasser zu holen. Die andern sechs liefen mit und weil jeder der erste beim Schöpfen sein wollte, so fiel ihnen der Krug in den Brunnen. Da standen sie und wussten nicht was sie tun sollten, und keiner getraute sich heim. Als sie immer nicht zurück kamen, ward der Vater ungeduldig und sprach „gewis haben sies wieder über ein Spiel vergessen, die gottlosen Jungen.“ Es ward ihm angst das Mädchen müsste ungetauft verscheiden und im Ärger rief er „ich wollte dass die Jungen alle zu Raben würden.“ Kaum war das Wort ausgeredet, so hörte er ein Geschwirr über seinem Haupt in der Luft, blickte in die Höhe und sah sieben kohlschwarze Raben auf und davon fliegen.\n\nDie Eltern konnten die Verwünschung nicht mehr zurücknehmen, und so traurig sie über den Verlust ihrer sieben Söhne waren, trösteten sie sich doch einigermassen durch ihr liebes Töchterchen, das bald zu Kräften kam, und mit jedem Tage schöner ward. Es wusste lange Zeit nicht einmal dass es Geschwister gehabt hatte, denn die Eltern hüteten sich ihrer zu erwähnen, bis es eines Tags von ungefähr die Leute von sich sprechen hörte, das Mädchen wäre wohl schön, aber doch eigentlich Schuld an dem Unglück seiner sieben Brüder. Da ward es ganz betrübt, gieng zu Vater und Mutter und fragte ob es denn Brüder gehabt hätte und wo sie hingeraten wären? Nun durften die Eltern das Geheimnis nicht länger verschweigen, sagten jedoch es sei so des Himmels Verhängnis und seine Geburt nur der unschuldige Anlass gewesen. Allein das Mädchen machte sich täglich ein Gewissen daraus und glaubte es müsste seine Geschwister wieder erlösen. Es hatte nicht Ruhe und Rast, bis es sich heimlich aufmachte und in die weite Welt gieng, seine Brüder irgendwo aufzuspüren und zu befreien, es möchte kosten was es wollte. Es nahm nichts mit sich als ein Ringlein von seinen Eltern zum Andenken, einen Laib Brot für den Hunger, ein Krüglein Wasser für den Durst, und ein Stühlchen für die Müdigkeit.\n\nNun gieng es immer zu, weit weit bis an der Welt Ende. Da kam es zur Sonne, aber die war zu heiss und fürchterlich, und frass die kleinen Kinder. Eilig lief es weg und lief hin zu dem Mond, aber der war gar zu kalt und auch grausig und bös, und als er das Kind merkte, sprach er „ich rieche Menschenfleisch.“ Da machte es sich geschwind fort und kam zu den Sternen, die waren ihm freundlich und gut, und jeder sass auf seinem besondern Stühlchen. Der Morgenstern aber stand auf, gab ihm ein Hinkelbeinchen und sprach „wenn du das Beinchen nicht hast, kannst du den Glasberg nicht aufschliessen, und in dem Glasberg da sind deine Brüder.“\n\nDas Mädchen nahm das Beinchen, wickelte es wohl in ein Tüchlein, und gieng wieder fort so lange bis es an den Glasberg kam. Das Tor war verschlossen und es wollte das Beinchen hervor holen, aber wie es das Tüchlein aufmachte, so war es leer, und es hatte das Geschenk der guten Sterne verloren. Was sollte es nun anfangen? seine Brüder wollte es erretten und hatte keinen Schlüssel zum Glasberg. Das gute Schwesterchen nahm ein Messer, schnitt sich ein kleines Fingerchen ab, steckte es in das Tor und schloss glücklich auf. Als es eingegangen war, kam ihm ein Zwerglein entgegen, das sprach „mein Kind, was suchst du?“ „Ich suche meine Brüder, die sieben Raben,“ antwortete es. Der Zwerg sprach „die Herren Raben sind nicht zu Haus, aber willst du hier so lang warten, bis sie kommen, so tritt ein.“ Darauf trug das Zwerglein die Speise der Raben herein auf sieben Tellerchen und in sieben Becherchen, und von jedem Tellerchen ass das Schwesterchen ein Bröckchen, und aus jedem Becherchen trank es ein Schlückchen; in das letzte Becherchen aber liess es das Ringlein fallen, das es mitgenommen hatte.\n\nAuf einmal hörte es in der Luft ein Geschwirr und ein Geweh, da sprach das Zwerglein „jetzt kommen die Herren Raben heim geflogen.“ Da kamen sie, wollten essen und trinken, und suchten ihre Tellerchen und Becherchen. Da sprach einer nach dem andern „wer hat von meinem Tellerchen gegessen? wer hat aus meinem Becherchen getrunken? das ist eines Menschen Mund gewesen.“ Und wie der siebente auf den Grund des Bechers kam, rollte ihm das Ringlein entgegen. Da sah er es an und erkannte dass es ein Ring von Vater und Mutter war, und sprach „Gott gebe, unser Schwesterlein wäre da, so wären wir erlöst.“ Wie das Mädchen, das hinter der Türe stand und lauschte, den Wunsch hörte, so trat es hervor, und da bekamen alle die Raben ihre menschliche Gestalt wieder. Und sie herzten und küssten einander, und zogen fröhlich heim."

        "text": "Aschenbuttel.\n\nEinem reichen Manne dem wurde seine Frau krank, und als sie fühlte dass ihr Ende heran kam, rief sie ihr einziges Töchterlein zu sich ans Bett und sprach „liebes Kind, bleib fromm und gut, so wird dir der liebe Gott immer beistehen, und ich will vom Himmel auf dich herabblicken, und will um dich sein.“ Darauf tat sie die Augen zu und verschied. Das Mädchen gieng jeden Tag hinaus zu dem Grabe der Mutter und weinte, und blieb fromm und gut. Als der Winter kam, deckte der Schnee ein weisses Tüchlein auf das Grab, und als die Sonne im Frühjahr es wieder herabgezogen hatte, nahm sich der Mann eine andere Frau.\n\nDie Frau hatte zwei Töchter mit ins Haus gebracht, die schön und weiss von Angesicht waren, aber garstig und schwarz von Herzen. Da gieng eine schlimme Zeit für das arme Stiefkind an. „Soll die dumme Gans bei uns in der Stube sitzen!“ sprachen sie, „wer Brot essen will, muss es verdienen. Hinaus mit der Küchenmagd.“ Sie nahmen ihm seine schönen Kleider weg, zogen ihm einen grauen alten Kittel an, und gaben ihm hölzerne Schuhe. „Seht einmal die stolze Prinzessin, wie sie geputzt ist!“ riefen sie, lachten und führten es in die Küche. Da musste es von Morgen bis Abend schwere Arbeit tun, früh vor Tag aufstehn, Wasser tragen, Feuer anmachen, kochen und waschen. Obendrein taten ihm die Schwestern alles ersinnliche Herzeleid an, verspotteten es und schütteten ihm die Erbsen und Linsen in die Asche, so dass es sitzen und sie wieder auslesen musste. Abends, wenn es sich müde gearbeitet hatte, kam es in kein Bett, sondern musste sich neben den Herd in die Asche legen. Und weil es darum immer staubig und schmutzig aussah, nannten sie es Aschenputtel.\n\nEs trug sich zu, dass der Vater einmal in die Messe ziehen wollte, da fragte er die beiden Stieftöchter was er ihnen mitbringen sollte? „Schöne Kleider“ sagte die eine, „Perlen und Edelsteine“ die zweite. „Aber du, Aschenputtel,“ sprach er, „was willst du haben?“ „Vater, das erste Reis, das euch auf eurem Heimweg an den Hut stösst, das brecht für mich ab.“ Er kaufte nun für die beiden Stiefschwestern schöne Kleider, Perlen und Edelsteine, und auf dem Rückweg, als er durch einen grünen Busch ritt, streifte ihn ein Haselreis und stiess ihm den Hut ab. Da brach er das Reis ab und nahm es mit. Als er nach Haus kam, gab er den Stieftöchtern was sie sich gewünscht hatten, und dem Aschenputtel gab er das Reis von dem Haselbusch. Aschenputtel dankte ihm, gieng zu seiner Mutter Grab und pflanzte das Reis darauf, und weinte so sehr, dass die Tränen darauf niederfielen und es begossen. Es wuchs aber, und ward ein schöner Baum. Aschenputtel gieng alle Tage dreimal darunter, weinte und betete, und allemal kam ein weisses Vöglein auf den Baum, und wenn es einen Wunsch aussprach, so warf ihm das Vöglein herab was es sich gewünscht hatte.\n\nEs begab sich aber, dass der König ein Fest anstellte, das drei Tage dauern sollte, und wozu alle schönen Jungfrauen im Lande eingeladen wurden, damit sich sein Sohn eine Braut aussuchen möchte. Die zwei Stiefschwestern als sie hörten dass sie auch dabei erscheinen sollten, waren guter Dinge, riefen Aschenputtel, und sprachen „kämm uns die Haare, bürste uns die Schuhe und mache uns die Schnallen fest, wir gehen zur Hochzeit auf des Königs Schloss.“ Aschenputtel gehorchte, weinte aber, weil es auch gern zum Tanz mitgegangen wäre, und bat die Stiefmutter sie möchte es ihm erlauben. „Du Aschenputtel,“ sprach sie, „bist voll Staub und Schmutz und willst zur Hochzeit? du hast keine Kleider und Schuhe, und willst tanzen!“ Als es aber mit Bitten anhielt, sprach sie endlich „da habe ich dir eine Schüssel Linsen in die Asche geschüttet, wenn du die Linsen in zwei Stunden wieder ausgelesen hast, so sollst du mitgehen.“ Das Mädchen gieng durch die Hintertüre nach dem Garten und rief „ihr zahmen Täubchen, ihr Turteltäubchen, all ihr Vöglein unter dem Himmel, kommt und helft mir lesen,\n\ndie guten ins Töpfchen,\ndie schlechten ins Kröpfchen.“\n\nDa kamen zum Küchenfenster zwei weisse Täubchen herein, und danach die Turteltäubchen, und endlich schwirrten und schwärmten alle Vöglein unter dem Himmel herein, und liessen sich um die Asche nieder. Und die Täubchen nickten mit den Köpfchen und fiengen an pik, pik, pik, pik, und da fiengen die übrigen auch an pik, pik, pik, pik, und lasen alle guten Körnlein in die Schüssel. Kaum war eine Stunde herum, so waren sie schon fertig und flogen alle wieder hinaus. Da brachte das Mädchen die Schüssel der Stiefmutter, freute sich und glaubte es dürfte nun mit auf die Hochzeit gehen. Aber sie sprach „nein, Aschenputtel, du hast keine Kleider, und kannst nicht tanzen. Du wirst nur ausgelacht.“ Als es nun weinte, sprach sie „wenn du mir zwei Schüsseln voll Linsen in einer Stunde aus der Asche rein lesen kannst, so sollst du mitgehen,“ und dachte „das kann es ja nimmermehr.“ Als sie die zwei Schüsseln Linsen in die Asche geschüttet hatte, gieng das Mädchen durch die Hintertüre nach dem Garten und rief „ihr zahmen Täubchen, ihr Turteltäubchen, all ihr Vöglein unter dem Himmel, kommt und helft mir lesen,\n\ndie guten ins Töpfchen,\ndie schlechten ins Kröpfchen.“\n\nDa kamen zum Küchenfenster zwei weisse Täubchen herein und danach die Turteltäubchen, und endlich schwirrten und schwärmten alle Vöglein unter dem Himmel herein, und liessen sich um die Asche nieder. Und die Täubchen nickten mit ihren Köpfchen und fiengen an pik, pik, pik, pik, und da fiengen die übrigen auch an pik, pik, pik, pik, und lasen alle guten Körner in die Schüsseln. Und eh eine halbe Stunde herum war, waren sie schon fertig, und flogen alle wieder hinaus. Da trug das Mädchen die Schüsseln zu der Stiefmutter, freute sich und glaubte nun dürfte es mit auf die Hochzeit gehen. Aber sie sprach „es hilft dir alles nichts. Du kommst nicht mit, denn du hast keine Kleider und kannst nicht tanzen; wir müssten uns deiner schämen.“ Darauf kehrte sie ihm den Rücken zu und eilte mit ihren zwei stolzen Töchtern fort.\n\nAls nun niemand mehr daheim war, gieng Aschenputtel zu seiner Mutter Grab unter den Haselbaum und rief\n\n„Bäumchen, rüttel dich und schüttel dich\nwirf Gold und Silber über mich.“\n\nDa warf ihm der Vogel ein golden und silbern Kleid herunter, und mit Seide und Silber ausgestickte Pantoffeln. In aller Eile zog es das Kleid an und gieng zur Hochzeit. Seine Schwestern aber und die Stiefmutter kannten es nicht, und meinten es müsste eine fremde Königstochter sein, so schön sah es in dem goldenen Kleide aus. An Aschenputtel dachten sie gar nicht und dachten es sässe daheim im Schmutz und suchte die Linsen aus der Asche. Der Königssohn kam ihm entgegen, nahm es bei der Hand und tanzte mit ihm. Er wollte auch mit sonst niemand tanzen, also dass er ihm die Hand nicht los liess, und wenn ein anderer kam, es aufzufordern, sprach er „das ist meine Tänzerin.“\n\nEs tanzte bis es Abend war, da wollte es nach Haus gehen. Der Königssohn aber sprach „ich gehe mit und begleite dich,“ denn er wollte sehen wem das schöne Mädchen angehörte. Sie entwischte ihm aber und sprang in das Taubenhaus. Nun wartete der Königssohn bis der Vater kam und sagte ihm das fremde Mädchen wär in das Taubenhaus gesprungen. Der Alte dachte „sollte es Aschenputtel sein,“ und sie mussten ihm Axt und Hacken bringen, damit er das Taubenhaus entzwei schlagen konnte, aber es war niemand darin. Und als sie ins Haus kamen, lag Aschenputtel in seinen schmutzigen Kleidern in der Asche, und ein trübes Öllämpchen brannte im Schornstein; denn Aschenputtel war geschwind aus dem Taubenhaus hinten herab gesprungen, und war zu dem Haselbäumchen gelaufen, da hatte es die schönen Kleider abgezogen und aufs Grab gelegt, und der Vogel hatte sie wieder weggenommen, und dann hatte es sich in seinem grauen Kittelchen in die Küche zur Asche gesetzt.\n\nAm andern Tag, als das Fest von neuem anhub, und die Eltern und Stiefschwestern wieder fort waren, gieng Aschenputtel zu dem Haselbaum und sprach\n\n„Bäumchen, rüttel dich und schüttel dich,\nwirf Gold und Silber über mich.“\n\nDa warf der Vogel ein noch viel stolzeres Kleid herab, als am vorigen Tag. Und als es mit diesem Kleide auf der Hochzeit erschien, erstaunte jedermann über seine Schönheit. Der Königssohn aber hatte gewartet bis es kam, nahm es gleich bei der Hand und tanzte nur allein mit ihm. Wenn die andern kamen und es aufforderten, sprach er „das ist meine Tänzerin.“ Als es nun Abend war, wollte es fort, und der Königssohn gieng ihm nach und wollte sehen in welches Haus es gieng, aber es sprang ihm fort und in den Garten hinter dem Haus. Darin stand ein schöner grosser Baum an dem die herrlichsten Birnen hiengen, es kletterte so behend wie ein Eichhörnchen zwischen die Äste, und der Königssohn wusste nicht wo es hingekommen war. Er wartete aber bis der Vater kam und sprach zu ihm „das fremde Mädchen ist mir entwischt, und ich glaube es ist auf den Birnbaum gesprungen.“ Der Vater dachte „sollte es Aschenputtel sein,“ liess sich die Axt holen und hieb den Baum um, aber es war niemand darauf. Und als sie in die Küche kamen, lag Aschenputtel da in der Asche, wie sonst auch, denn es war auf der andern Seite vom Baum herabgesprungen, hatte dem Vogel auf dem Haselbäumchen die schönen Kleider wieder gebracht und sein graues Kittelchen angezogen.\n\nAm dritten Tag, als die Eltern und Schwestern fort waren, gieng Aschenputtel wieder zu seiner Mutter Grab und sprach zu dem Bäumchen\n\n„Bäumchen, rüttel dich und schüttel dich,\nwirf Gold und Silber über mich.“\n\nNun warf ihm der Vogel ein Kleid herab, das war so prächtig und glänzend wie es noch keins gehabt hatte, und die Pantoffeln waren ganz golden. Als es in dem Kleid zu der Hochzeit kam, wussten sie alle nicht was sie vor Verwunderung sagen sollten. Der Königssohn tanzte ganz allein mit ihm, und wenn es einer aufforderte, sprach er „das ist meine Tänzerin.“\n\nAls es nun Abend war, wollte Aschenputtel fort, und der Königssohn wollte es begleiten, aber es entsprang ihm so geschwind dass er nicht folgen konnte. Der Königssohn hatte aber eine List gebraucht, und hatte die ganze Treppe mit Pech bestreichen lassen. Da war, als es hinabsprang, der linke Pantoffel des Mädchens hängen geblieben. Der Königssohn hob ihn auf, und er war klein und zierlich und ganz golden. Am nächsten Morgen gieng er damit zu dem Mann, und sagte zu ihm „keine andere soll meine Gemahlin werden als die, an deren Fuss dieser goldene Schuh passt.“ Da freuten sich die beiden Schwestern, denn sie hatten schöne Füsse. Die Älteste gieng mit dem Schuh in die Kammer und wollte ihn anprobieren, und die Mutter stand dabei. Aber sie konnte mit der grossen Zehe nicht hineinkommen, und der Schuh war ihr zu klein, da reichte ihr die Mutter ein Messer und sprach „hau die Zehe ab, wann du Königin bist, so brauchst du nicht mehr zu Fuss zu gehen.“ Das Mädchen hieb die Zehe ab, zwängte den Fuss in den Schuh, verbiss den Schmerz und gieng heraus zum Königssohn. Da nahm er sie als seine Braut aufs Pferd, und ritt mit ihr fort. Sie mussten aber an dem Grabe vorbei, da sassen die zwei Täubchen auf dem Haselbäumchen, und riefen\n\n„rucke di guck, rucke di guck,\nBlut ist im Schuck (Schuh):\nDer Schuck ist zu klein,\ndie rechte Braut sitzt noch daheim.“\n\nDa blickte er auf ihren Fuss und sah wie das Blut herausquoll. Er wendete sein Pferd um, brachte die falsche Braut wieder nach Haus und sagte das wäre nicht die rechte, die andere Schwester sollte den Schuh anziehen. Da gieng diese in die Kammer und kam mit den Zehen glücklich in den Schuh, aber die Ferse war zu gross. Da reichte ihr die Mutter ein Messer und sprach „hau ein Stück von der Ferse ab, wann du Königin bist, brauchst du nicht mehr zu Fuss zu gehen.“ Das Mädchen hieb ein Stück von der Ferse ab, zwängte den Fuss in den Schuh, verbiss den Schmerz und gieng heraus zum Königssohn. Da nahm er sie als seine Braut aufs Pferd und ritt mit ihr fort. Als sie an dem Haselbäumchen vorbeikamen, sassen die zwei Täubchen darauf und riefen\n\n„rucke di guck, rucke di guck,\nBlut ist im Schuck, der Schuck ist zu klein, die rechte Braut sitzt noch daheim.“\n\nEr blickte nieder auf ihren Fuss, und sah wie das Blut aus dem Schuh quoll und an den weissen Strümpfen ganz rot heraufgestiegen war. Da wendete er sein Pferd, und brachte die falsche Braut wieder nach Haus. „Das ist auch nicht die rechte,“ sprach er, „habt ihr keine andere Tochter?“ „Nein,“ sagte der Mann, „nur von meiner verstorbenen Frau ist noch ein kleines verbuttetes Aschenputtel da. Das kann unmöglich die Braut sein.“ Der Königssohn sprach er sollte es heraufschicken, die Mutter aber antwortete „ach nein, das ist viel zu schmutzig, das darf sich nicht sehen lassen.“ Er wollte es aber durchaus haben, und Aschenputtel musste gerufen werden. Da wusch es sich erst Hände und Angesicht rein, gieng dann hin und neigte sich vor dem Königssohn, der ihm den goldenen Schuh reichte. Dann setzte es sich auf einen Schemel, zog den Fuss aus dem schweren Holzschuh und steckte ihn in den Pantoffel, der war wie angegossen. Und als es sich in die Höhe richtete und der König ihm ins Gesicht sah, so erkannte er das schöne Mädchen, das mit ihm getanzt hatte, und rief „das ist die rechte Braut!“ Die Stiefmutter und die beiden Schwestern erschraken und wurden bleich vor Ärger. Er aber nahm Aschenputtel aufs Pferd und ritt mit ihm fort. Als sie an dem Haselbäumchen vorbei kamen, riefen die zwei weissen Täubchen\n\n„rucke di guck, rucke di guck, kein Blut im Schuck. Der Schuck ist nicht zu klein, die rechte Braut, die führt er heim.“\n\nUnd als sie das gerufen hatten, kamen sie beide herab geflogen und setzten sich dem Aschenputtel auf die Schultern, eine rechts, die andere links, und blieben da sitzen.\n\nAls die Hochzeit mit dem Königssohn sollte gehalten werden, kamen die falschen Schwestern, wollten sich einschmeicheln und Teil an seinem Glück nehmen. Als die Brautleute nun zur Kirche giengen, war die älteste zur rechten, die jüngste zur linken Seite. Da pickten die Tauben einer jeden das eine Auge aus. Hernach als sie heraus giengen, war die älteste zur linken und die jüngste zur rechten. Da pickten die Tauben einer jeden das andere Auge aus. Und waren sie also für ihre Bosheit und Falschheit mit Blindheit auf ihr Lebtag gestraft."

        "text": "Rumpelstilzchen.\n\nEs war einmal ein Müller, der war arm, aber er hatte eine schöne Tochter. Nun traf es sich, dass er mit dem König zu sprechen kam, und um sich ein Ansehen zu geben, sagte er zu ihm „ich habe eine Tochter, die kann Stroh zu Gold spinnen.“ Der König sprach zum Müller „das ist eine Kunst, die mir wohl gefällt, wenn deine Tochter so geschickt ist, wie du sagst, so bring sie Morgen in mein Schloss, da will ich sie auf die Probe stellen.“ Als nun das Mädchen zu ihm gebracht ward, führte er es in eine Kammer, die ganz voll Stroh lag, gab ihr Rad und Haspel und sprach „jetzt mache dich an die Arbeit, und wenn du diese Nacht durch bis morgen früh dieses Stroh nicht zu Gold versponnen hast, so musst du sterben.“ Darauf schloss er die Kammer selbst zu, und sie blieb allein darin.\n\nDa sass nun die arme Müllerstochter und wusste um ihr Leben keinen Rat. Sie verstand gar nichts davon, wie man Stroh zu Gold spinnen konnte, und ihre Angst ward immer grösser, dass sie endlich zu weinen anfieng. Da gieng auf einmal die Türe auf, und trat ein kleines Männchen herein und sprach „guten Abend, Jungfer Müllerin, warum weint sie so sehr?“ „Ach,“ antwortete das Mädchen, „ich soll Stroh zu Gold spinnen, und verstehe das nicht.“ Sprach das Männchen „was gibst du mir, wenn ich dirs spinne?“ „Mein Halsband“ sagte das Mädchen. Das Männchen nahm das Halsband, setzte sich vor das Rädchen, und schnurr, schnurr, schnurr, dreimal gezogen, war die Spule voll. Dann steckte es eine andere auf, und schnurr, schnurr, schnurr, dreimal gezogen, war auch die zweite voll und so giengs fort bis zum Morgen, da war alles Stroh versponnen, und alle Spulen waren voll Gold. Bei Sonnenaufgang kam schon der König und als er das Gold erblickte, erstaunte er und freute sich, aber sein Herz ward nur noch goldgieriger. Er liess die Müllerstochter in eine andere Kammer voll Stroh bringen, die noch viel grösser war, und befahl ihr das auch in einer Nacht zu spinnen, wenn ihr das Leben lieb wäre. Das Mädchen wusste sich nicht zu helfen und weinte, da gieng abermals die Türe auf, und das kleine Männchen erschien und sprach „was gibst du mir, wenn ich dir das Stroh zu Gold spinne?“ „Meinen Ring von dem Finger“ antwortete das Mädchen. Das Männchen nahm den Ring, fieng wieder an zu schnurren mit dem Rade und hatte bis zum Morgen alles Stroh zu glänzendem Gold gesponnen. Der König freute sich über die Massen bei dem Anblick, war aber noch immer nicht Goldes satt, sondern liess die Müllerstochter in eine noch grössere Kammer voll Stroh bringen und sprach „die musst du noch in dieser Nacht verspinnen. Gelingt dirs aber, so sollst du meine Gemahlin werden.“ „Wenns auch eine Müllerstochter ist,“ dachte er, „eine reichere Frau finde ich in der ganzen Welt nicht.“ Als das Mädchen allein war, kam das Männlein zum drittenmal wieder und sprach „was gibst du mir, wenn ich dir noch diesmal das Stroh spinne?“ „Ich habe nichts mehr, das ich geben könnte“ antwortete das Mädchen. „So versprich mir, wenn du Königin wirst, dein erstes Kind.“ „Wer weiss wie das noch geht“ dachte die Müllerstochter und wusste sich auch in der Not nicht anders zu helfen; sie versprach also dem Männchen was es verlangte, und das Männchen spann dafür noch einmal das Stroh zu Gold. Und als am Morgen der König kam und alles fand wie er gewünscht hatte, so hielt er Hochzeit mit ihr, und die schöne Müllerstochter ward eine Königin.\n\nÜber ein Jahr brachte sie ein schönes Kind zur Welt und dachte gar nicht mehr an das Männchen. Da trat es plötzlich in ihre Kammer und sprach „nun gib mir was du versprochen hast.“ Die Königin erschrack und bot dem Männchen alle Reichtümer des Königreichs an, wenn es ihr das Kind lassen wollte, aber das Männchen sprach „nein, etwas lebendes ist mir lieber als alle Schätze der Welt.“ Da fieng die Königin so an zu jammern und zu weinen, dass das Männchen Mitleid mit ihr hatte. „Drei Tage will ich dir Zeit lassen,“ sprach er, „wenn du bis dahin meinen Namen weisst, so sollst du dein Kind behalten.“\n\nNun besann sich die Königin die ganze Nacht über auf alle Namen, die sie jemals gehört hatte, und schickte einen Boten über Land, der sollte sich erkundigen weit und breit was es sonst noch für Namen gäbe. Als am andern Tag das Männchen kam, fieng sie an mit Caspar, Melchior, Balzer, und sagte alle Namen, die sie wusste, nach der Reihe her, aber bei jedem sprach das Männlein „so heiss ich nicht.“ Den zweiten Tag liess sie in der Nachbarschaft herumfragen wie die Leute da genannt würden, und sagte dem Männlein die ungewöhnlichsten und seltsamsten Namen vor, „heisst du vielleicht Rippenbiest oder Hammelswade oder Schnürbein?“ aber es antwortete immer „so heiss ich nicht.“ Den dritten Tag kam der Bote wieder zurück und erzählte „neue Namen habe ich keinen einzigen finden können, aber wie ich an einen hohen Berg um die Waldecke kam, wo Fuchs und Has sich gute Nacht sagen, so sah ich da ein kleines Haus, und vor dem Haus brannte ein Feuer, und um das Feuer sprang ein gar zu lächerliches Männchen, hüpfte auf einem Bein und schrie\n\n„heute back ich, morgen brau ich,\nübermorgen hol ich der Königin ihr Kind;\nach, wie gut ist dass niemand weiss\ndass ich Rumpelstilzchen heiss!“\n\nDa könnt ihr denken wie die Königin froh war, als sie den Namen hörte, und als bald hernach das Männlein herein trat und fragte „nun, Frau Königin, wie heiss ich?“ fragte sie erst „heissest du Kunz?“ „Nein.“ „Heissest du Heinz?“ „Nein.“\n\n„Heisst du etwa Rumpelstilzchen?“\n\n„Das hat dir der Teufel gesagt, das hat dir der Teufel gesagt“ schrie das Männlein und stiess mit dem rechten Fuss vor Zorn so tief in die Erde, dass es bis an den Leib hineinfuhr, dann packte es in seiner Wut den linken Fuss mit beiden Händen und riss sich selbst mitten entzwei."

        "text": "Rapunzel.\n\nEs war einmal eine Frau und ein Mann, die wünschten sich schon lange vergeblich ein Kind, endlich machte sich die Frau Hoffnung der liebe Gott werde ihren Wunsch erfüllen. Die Leute hatten in ihrem Hinterhaus ein kleines Fenster. Aus diesem konnte man in einen prächtigen Garten sehen, der voll der schönsten Blumen und Kräuter stand; er war aber von einer hohen Mauer umgeben, und niemand wagte hinein zu gehen, weil er einer Zauberin gehörte, die grosse Macht hatte und von aller Welt gefürchtet ward. Eines Tags stand die Frau an diesem Fenster und sah in den Garten hinab, da erblickte sie ein Beet, das mit den schönsten Rapunzeln bepflanzt war und sie sahen so frisch und grün aus, dass sie lüstern ward und das grösste Verlangen empfand von den Rapunzeln zu essen. Das Verlangen nahm jeden Tag zu, und da sie wusste dass sie keine davon bekommen konnte, so fiel sie ganz ab, sah blass und elend aus. Da erschrack der Mann und fragte „was fehlt dir, liebe Frau?“ „Ach,“ antwortete sie, „wenn ich keine Rapunzeln aus dem Garten hinter unserm Hause zu essen kriege, so sterbe ich.“ Der Mann, der sie lieb hatte, dachte „eh du deine Frau sterben lässest, holst du ihr von den Rapunzeln, es mag kosten was es will.“ In der Abenddämmerung stieg er also über die Mauer in den Garten der Zauberin, stach in aller Eile eine Hand voll Rapunzeln und brachte sie seiner Frau. Sie machte sich sogleich Salat daraus und ass sie in voller Begierde auf. Sie hatten ihr aber so gut, so gut geschmeckt, dass sie den andern Tag noch dreimal so viel Lust bekam. Sollte sie Ruhe haben, so musste der Mann noch einmal in den Garten steigen. Er machte sich also in der Abenddämmerung wieder hinab, als er aber die Mauer herabgeklettert war, erschrack er gewaltig, denn er sah die Zauberin vor sich stehen. „Wie kannst du es wagen,“ sprach sie mit zornigem Blick, „in meinen Garten zu steigen und wie ein Dieb mir meine Rapunzeln zu stehlen? das soll dir schlecht bekommen.“ „Ach,“ antwortete er, „lasst Gnade für Recht ergehen, ich habe mich nur aus Not dazu entschlossen. Meine Frau hat eure Rapunzeln aus dem Fenster erblickt, und empfindet ein so grosses Gelüsten, dass sie sterben würde, wenn sie nicht davon zu essen bekäme.“ Da liess die Zauberin in ihrem Zorne nach und sprach zu ihm „verhält es sich so, wie du sagst, so will ich dir gestatten Rapunzeln mitzunehmen so viel du willst, allein ich mache eine Bedingung. Du musst mir das Kind geben, das deine Frau zur Welt bringen wird. Es soll ihm gut gehen, und ich will für es sorgen wie eine Mutter.“ Der Mann sagte in der Angst alles zu, und als die Frau in Wochen kam, so erschien sogleich die Zauberin, gab dem Kinde den Namen Rapunzel und nahm es mit sich fort.\n\nRapunzel ward das schönste Kind unter der Sonne. Als es zwölf Jahre alt war, schloss es die Zauberin in einen Turm, der in einem Walde lag, und weder Treppe noch Türe hatte, nur ganz oben war ein kleines Fensterchen. Wenn die Zauberin hinein wollte, so stellte sie sich unten hin, und rief\n\n„Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nlass mir dein Haar herunter.“\n\nRapunzel hatte lange prächtige Haare, fein wie gesponnen Gold. Wenn sie nun die Stimme der Zauberin vernahm, so band sie ihre Zöpfe los, wickelte sie oben um einen Fensterhaken, und dann fielen die Haare zwanzig Ellen tief herunter, und die Zauberin stieg daran hinauf.\n\nNach ein paar Jahren trug es sich zu, dass der Sohn des Königs durch den Wald ritt und an dem Turm vorüber kam. Da hörte er einen Gesang, der war so lieblich, dass er still hielt und horchte. Das war Rapunzel, die in ihrer Einsamkeit sich die Zeit damit vertrieb, ihre süsse Stimme erschallen zu lassen. Der Königssohn wollte zu ihr hinauf steigen und suchte nach einer Türe des Turms, aber es war keine zu finden. Er ritt heim, doch der Gesang hatte ihm so sehr das Herz gerührt, dass er jeden Tag hinaus in den Wald gieng und zuhörte. Als er einmal so hinter einem Baum stand, sah er dass eine Zauberin heran kam und hörte wie sie hinauf rief\n\n„Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nlass dein Haar herunter.“\n\nDa liess Rapunzel die Haarflechten herab, und die Zauberin stieg zu ihr hinauf. „Ist das die Leiter, auf welcher man hinauf kommt, so will ich auch einmal mein Glück versuchen.“ Und den folgenden Tag, als es anfieng dunkel zu werden, gieng er zu dem Turme und rief\n\n„Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nlass dein Haar herunter.“\n\nAlsbald fielen die Haare herab und der Königssohn stieg hinauf.\n\nAnfangs erschrack Rapunzel gewaltig als ein Mann zu ihr herein kam, wie ihre Augen noch nie einen erblickt hatten, doch der Königssohn fing an ganz freundlich mit ihr zu reden und erzählte ihr dass von ihrem Gesang sein Herz so sehr sei bewegt worden, dass es ihm keine Ruhe gelassen, und er sie selbst habe sehen müssen. Da verlor Rapunzel ihre Angst, und als er sie fragte ob sie ihn zum Manne nehmen wollte, und sie sah dass er jung und schön war, so dachte sie „der wird mich lieber haben als die alte Frau Gothel,“ und sagte ja und legte ihre Hand in seine Hand. Sie sprach „ich will gerne mit dir gehen, aber ich weiss nicht wie ich herab kommen kann. Wenn du kommst, so bring jedesmal einen Strang Seide mit, daraus will ich eine Leiter flechten und wenn die fertig ist, so steige ich herunter und du nimmst mich auf dein Pferd.“ Sie verabredeten dass er bis dahin alle Abend zu ihr kommen sollte, denn bei Tag kam die Alte. Die Zauberin merkte auch nichts davon, bis einmal Rapunzel anfieng und zu ihr sagte „sag sie mir doch, Frau Gothel, wie kommt es nur, sie wird mir viel schwerer heraufzuziehen, als der junge Königssohn, der ist in einem Augenblick bei mir.“ „Ach du gottloses Kind,“ rief die Zauberin, „was muss ich von dir hören, ich dachte ich hätte dich von aller Welt geschieden, und du hast mich doch betrogen!“ In ihrem Zorne packte sie die schönen Haare der Rapunzel, schlug sie ein paar mal um ihre linke Hand, griff eine Scheere mit der rechten, und ritsch, ratsch, waren sie abgeschnitten, und die schönen Flechten lagen auf der Erde. Und sie war so unbarmherzig dass sie die arme Rapunzel in eine Wüstenei brachte, wo sie in grossem Jammer und Elend leben musste.\n\nDenselben Tag aber, wo sie Rapunzel verstossen hatte, machte Abends die Zauberin die abgeschnittenen Flechten oben am Fensterhaken fest, und als der Königssohn kam und rief\n\n„Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\nlass dein Haar herunter,“\n\nso liess sie die Haare hinab. Der Königssohn stieg hinauf, aber er fand oben nicht seine liebste Rapunzel, sondern die Zauberin, die ihn mit bösen und giftigen Blicken ansah. „Aha,“ rief sie höhnisch, „du willst die Frau Liebste holen, aber der schöne Vogel sitzt nicht mehr im Nest und singt nicht mehr, die Katze hat ihn geholt und wird dir auch noch die Augen auskratzen. Für dich ist Rapunzel verloren, du wirst sie nie wieder erblicken.“ Der Königssohn geriet ausser sich vor Schmerz, und in der Verzweiflung sprang er den Turm herab. Das Leben brachte er davon, aber die Dornen, in die er fiel, zerstachen ihm die Augen. Da irrte er blind im Walde umher, ass nichts als Wurzeln und Beeren, und tat nichts als jammern und weinen über den Verlust seiner liebsten Frau. So wanderte er einige Jahre im Elend umher und geriet endlich in die Wüstenei, wo Rapunzel mit den Zwillingen, die sie geboren hatte, einem Knaben und Mädchen, kümmerlich lebte. Er vernahm eine Stimme, und sie däuchte ihn so bekannt. Da gieng er darauf zu, und wie er heran kam, erkannte ihn Rapunzel und fiel ihm um den Hals und weinte. Zwei von ihren Tränen aber benetzten seine Augen, da wurden sie wieder klar, und er konnte damit sehen wie sonst. Er führte sie in sein Reich, wo er mit Freude empfangen ward, und sie lebten noch lange glücklich und vergnügt."

        "text": "Das tapfere Schneiderlein.\n\nAn einem Sommermorgen sass ein Schneiderlein auf seinem Tisch am Fenster, war guter Dinge und nähte aus Leibeskräften. Da kam eine Bauersfrau die Strasse herab und rief „gut Mus feil! gut Mus feil!“ Das klang dem Schneiderlein lieblich in die Ohren, er steckte sein zartes Haupt zum Fenster hinaus und rief „hier herauf, liebe Frau, hier wird sie ihre Waare los.“ Die Frau stieg die drei Treppen mit ihrem schweren Korbe zu dem Schneider herauf und musste die Töpfe sämmtlich vor ihm auspacken. Er besah sie alle, hob sie in die Höhe, hielt die Nase dran und sagte endlich „das Mus scheint mir gut, wieg sie mir doch vier Loth ab, liebe Frau, wenns auch ein Viertelpfund ist, kommt es mir nicht darauf an.“ Die Frau, welche gehofft hatte einen guten Absatz zu finden, gab ihm was er verlangte, gieng aber ganz ärgerlich und brummig fort. „Nun, das Mus soll mir Gott gesegnen,“ rief das Schneiderlein, „und soll mir Kraft und Stärke geben,“ holte das Brot aus dem Schrank, schnitt sich ein Stück über den ganzen Laib und strich das Mus darüber. „Das wird nicht bitter schmecken,“ sprach er, „aber erst will ich den Wams fertig machen, eh ich anbeisse.“ Er legte das Brot neben sich, nähte weiter und machte vor Freude immer grössere Stiche. Indess stieg der Geruch von dem süssen Mus hinauf an die Wand, wo die Fliegen in grosser Menge sassen, so dass sie heran gelockt wurden und sich scharenweiss darauf nieder liessen. „Ei, wer hat euch eingeladen?“ sprach das Schneiderlein, und jagte die ungebetenen Gäste fort. Die Fliegen aber, die kein deutsch verstanden, liessen sich nicht abweisen, sondern kamen in immer grösserer Gesellschaft wieder. Da lief dem Schneiderlein endlich, wie man sagt, die Laus über die Leber, es langte aus seiner Hölle nach einem Tuchlappen, und „wart, ich will es euch geben!“ schlug es unbarmherzig drauf. Als es abzog und zählte, so lagen nicht weniger als sieben vor ihm todt und streckten die Beine. „Bist du so ein Kerl?“ sprach er, und musste selbst seine Tapferkeit bewundern, „das soll die ganze Stadt erfahren.“ Und in der Hast schnitt sich das Schneiderlein einen Gürtel, nähte ihn und stickte mit grossen Buchstaben darauf: „siebene auf einen Streich!“ „Ei was Stadt!“ sprach er weiter, „die ganze Welt solls erfahren!“ und sein Herz wackelte ihm vor Freude wie ein Lämmerschwänzchen.\n\nDer Schneider band sich den Gürtel um den Leib, und wollte in die Welt hinaus, weil er meinte die Werkstätte sei zu klein für seine Tapferkeit. Eh er abzog, suchte er im Haus herum ob nichts da wäre, was er mitnehmen könnte, er fand aber nichts als einen alten Käs, den steckte er ein. Vor dem Tore bemerkte er einen Vogel, der sich im Gesträuch gefangen hatte, der musste zu dem Käse in die Tasche. Nun nahm er den Weg tapfer zwischen die Beine, und weil er leicht und behend war, fühlte er keine Müdigkeit. Der Weg führte ihn auf einen Berg, und als er den höchsten Gipfel erreicht hatte, so sass da ein gewaltiger Riese und schaute sich ganz gemächlich um. Das Schneiderlein gieng beherzt auf ihn zu, redete ihn an und sprach „guten Tag, Kamerad, gelt, du sitzest da, und besiehst dir die weitläuftige Welt? ich bin eben auf dem Wege dahin und will mich versuchen. Hast du Lust mit zu gehen?“ Der Riese sah den Schneider verächtlich an und sprach „du Lump! du miserabler Kerl!“ „Das wäre!“ antwortete das Schneiderlein, knöpfte den Rock auf und zeigte dem Riesen den Gürtel, „da kannst du lesen was ich für ein Mann bin.“ Der Riese las „siebene auf einen Streich,“ meinte das wären Menschen gewesen, die der Schneider erschlagen hätte, und kriegte ein wenig Respekt vor dem kleinen Kerl. Doch wollte er ihn erst prüfen, nahm einen Stein in die Hand, und drückte ihn zusammen dass das Wasser heraus tropfte. „Das mach mir nach,“ sprach der Riese, „wenn du Stärke hast.“ „Ists weiter nichts?“ sagte das Schneiderlein, „das ist bei unser einem Spielwerk,“ griff in die Tasche, holte den weichen Käs und drückte ihn dass der Saft heraus lief. „Gelt,“ sprach er, „das war ein wenig besser?“ Der Riese wusste nicht was er sagen sollte, und konnte es von dem Männlein nicht glauben. Da hob der Riese einen Stein auf und warf ihn so hoch, dass man ihn mit Augen kaum noch sehen konnte: „nun, du Erpelmännchen, das tu mir nach.“ „Gut geworfen,“ sagte der Schneider, „aber der Stein hat doch wieder zur Erde herabfallen müssen, ich will dir einen werfen, der soll gar nicht wieder kommen;“ griff in die Tasche, nahm den Vogel und warf ihn in die Luft. Der Vogel, froh über seine Freiheit, stieg auf, flog fort und kam nicht wieder. „Wie gefällt dir das Stückchen, Kamerad?“ fragte der Schneider. „Werfen kannst du wohl,“ sagte der Riese, „aber nun wollen wir sehen ob du im Stande bist etwas ordentliches zu tragen.“ Er führte das Schneiderlein zu einem mächtigen Eichbaum, der da gefällt auf dem Boden lag, und sagte „wenn du stark genug bist, so hilf mir den Baum aus dem Walde heraus tragen.“ „Gerne,“ antwortete der kleine Mann, „nimm du nur den Stamm auf deine Schulter, ich will die Äste mit dem Gezweig aufheben und tragen, das ist doch das schwerste.“ Der Riese nahm den Stamm auf die Schulter, der Schneider aber setzte sich auf einen Ast, und der Riese, der sich nicht umsehen konnte, musste den ganzen Baum und das Schneiderlein noch obendrein forttragen. Es war da hinten ganz lustig und guter Dinge, pfiff das Liedchen „es ritten drei Schneider zum Tore hinaus,“ als wäre das Baumtragen ein Kinderspiel. Der Riese, nachdem er ein Stück Wegs die schwere Last fortgeschleppt hatte, konnte nicht weiter und rief „hör, ich muss den Baum fallen lassen.“ Der Schneider sprang behendiglich herab, fasste den Baum mit beiden Armen, als wenn er ihn getragen hätte, und sprach zum Riesen „du bist ein so grosser Kerl und kannst den Baum nicht einmal tragen.“\n\nSie giengen zusammen weiter, und als sie an einem Kirschbaum vorbei kamen, fasste der Riese die Krone des Baums, wo die zeitigsten Früchte hiengen, bog sie herab, gab sie dem Schneider in die Hand und hiess ihn essen. Das Schneiderlein aber war viel zu schwach um den Baum zu halten, und als der Riese los liess, fuhr der Baum in die Höhe, und der Schneider ward mit in die Luft geschnellt. Als er wieder ohne Schaden herabgefallen war, sprach der Riese „was ist das, hast du nicht Kraft die schwache Gerte zu halten?“ „An der Kraft fehlt es nicht,“ antwortete das Schneiderlein, „meinst du das wäre etwas für einen, der siebene mit einem Streich getroffen hat? ich bin über den Baum gesprungen, weil die Jäger da unten in das Gebüsch schiessen. Spring nach, wenn dus vermagst.“ Der Riese machte den Versuch, konnte aber nicht über den Baum kommen, sondern blieb in den Ästen hängen, also dass das Schneiderlein auch hier die Oberhand behielt.\n\nDer Riese sprach „wenn du ein so tapferer Kerl bist, so komm mit in unsere Höhle und übernachte bei uns.“ Das Schneiderlein war bereit und folgte ihm. Als sie in der Höhle anlangten, sassen da noch andere Riesen beim Feuer, und jeder hatte ein gebratenes Schaf in der Hand und ass davon. Das Schneiderlein sah sich um und dachte „es ist doch hier viel weitläuftiger als in meiner Werkstatt.“ Der Riese wies ihm ein Bett an und sagte er sollte sich hineinlegen und ausschlafen. Dem Schneiderlein war aber das Bett zu gross, er legte sich nicht hinein, sondern kroch in eine Ecke. Als es Mitternacht war, und der Riese meinte das Schneiderlein läge in tiefem Schlafe, so stand er auf, nahm eine grosse Eisenstange und schlug das Bett mit einem Schlag durch, und meinte er hätte dem Grashüpfer den Garaus gemacht. Mit dem frühsten Morgen giengen die Riesen in den Wald und hatten das Schneiderlein ganz vergessen, da kam es auf einmal ganz lustig und verwegen daher geschritten. Die Riesen erschracken, fürchteten es schlüge sie alle todt und liefen in einer Hast fort.\n\nDas Schneiderlein zog weiter, immer seiner spitzen Nase nach. Nachdem es lange gewandert war, kam es in den Hof eines königlichen Palastes, und da es Müdigkeit empfand, so legte es sich ins Gras und schlief ein. Während es da lag, kamen die Leute, betrachteten es von allen Seiten und lasen auf dem Gürtel „siebene auf einen Streich.“ „Ach,“ sprachen sie, „was will der grosse Kriegsheld hier mitten im Frieden? Das muss ein mächtiger Herr sein.“ Sie giengen und meldeten es dem König, und meinten wenn Krieg ausbrechen sollte, wäre das ein wichtiger und nützlicher Mann, den man um keinen Preis fortlassen dürfte. Dem König gefiel der Rat und er schickte einen von seinen Hofleuten an das Schneiderlein ab, der sollte ihm, wenn es aufgewacht wäre, Kriegsdienste anbieten. Der Abgesandte blieb bei dem Schläfer stehen, wartete bis er seine Glieder streckte und die Augen aufschlug, und brachte dann seinen Antrag vor. „Eben deshalb bin ich hierher gekommen,“ antwortete er, „ich bin bereit in des Königs Dienste zu treten.“ Also ward er ehrenvoll empfangen und ihm eine besondere Wohnung angewiesen.\n\nDie Kriegsleute aber waren dem Schneiderlein aufgesessen und wünschten es wäre tausend Meilen weit weg. „Was soll daraus werden?“ sprachen sie untereinander, „wenn wir Zank mit ihm kriegen und er haut zu, so fallen auf jeden Streich siebene. Da kann unser einer nicht bestehen.“ Also fassten sie einen Entschluss, begaben sich allesammt zum König und baten um ihren Abschied. „Wir sind nicht gemacht,“ sprachen sie, „neben einem Mann auszuhalten, der siebene auf einen Streich schlägt.“ Der König war traurig dass er um des Einen willen alle seine treuen Diener verlieren sollte, wünschte dass seine Augen ihn nie gesehen hätten und wäre ihn gerne wieder los gewesen. Aber er getrauete sich nicht ihm den Abschied zu geben, weil er fürchtete er möchte ihn sammt seinem Volke todt schlagen und sich auf den königlichen Thron setzen. Er sann lange hin und her, endlich fand er einen Rat. Er schickte zu dem Schneiderlein und liess ihm sagen weil er ein so grosser Kriegsheld wäre, so wollte er ihm ein Anerbieten machen. In einem Walde seines Landes hausten zwei Riesen, die mit Rauben Morden Sengen und Brennen grossen Schaden stifteten. Niemand dürfte sich ihnen nahen ohne sich in Lebensgefahr zu setzen. Wenn er diese beiden Riesen überwände und tödtete, so wollte er ihm seine einzige Tochter zur Gemahlin geben und das halbe Königreich zur Ehesteuer; auch sollten hundert Reiter mit ziehen und ihm Beistand leisten. „Das wäre so etwas für einen Mann, wie du bist,“ dachte das Schneiderlein, „eine schöne Königstochter und ein halbes Königreich wird einem nicht alle Tage angeboten.“ „O ja,“ gab er zur Antwort, „die Riesen will ich schon bändigen, und habe die hundert Reiter dabei nicht nötig. Wer siebene auf einen Streich trifft, braucht sich vor zweien nicht zu fürchten.“\n\nDas Schneiderlein zog aus, und die hundert Reiter folgten ihm. Als er zu dem Rand des Waldes kam, sprach er zu seinen Begleitern „bleibt hier nur halten, ich will schon allein mit den Riesen fertig werden.“ Dann sprang er in den Wald hinein und schaute sich rechts und links um. Über ein Weilchen erblickte er beide Riesen. Sie lagen unter einem Baume und schliefen und schnarchten dabei, dass sich die Äste auf und nieder bogen. Das Schneiderlein, nicht faul, las beide Taschen voll Steine und stieg damit auf den Baum. Als es in der Mitte war, rutschte es auf einem Ast bis es gerade über die Schläfer zu sitzen kam, und liess dem einen Riesen einen Stein nach dem andern auf die Brust fallen. Der Riese spürte lange nichts, doch endlich wachte er auf, stiess seinen Gesellen an und sprach „was schlägst du mich.“ „Du träumst,“ sagte der andere, „ich schlage dich nicht.“ Sie legten sich wieder zum Schlaf, da warf der Schneider auf den zweiten einen Stein herab. „Was soll das?“ rief der andere, „warum wirfst du mich?“ „Ich werfe dich nicht,“ antwortete der erste und brummte. Sie zankten sich eine Weile herum, doch weil sie müde waren, liessen sies gut sein, und die Augen fielen ihnen wieder zu. Das Schneiderlein fieng sein Spiel von neuem an, suchte den dicksten Stein aus und warf ihn dem ersten Riesen mit aller Gewalt auf die Brust. „Das ist zu arg!“ schrie er, sprang wie ein Unsinniger auf und stiess seinen Gesellen wider den Baum dass dieser zitterte. Der andere zahlte mit gleicher Münze, und sie gerieten in solche Wut, dass sie Bäume ausrissen, auf einander los schlugen, so lang bis sie endlich beide zugleich todt auf die Erde fielen. Nun sprang das Schneiderlein herab. „Ein Glück nur,“ sprach es, „dass sie den Baum, auf dem ich sass, nicht ausgerissen haben, sonst hätte ich wie ein Eichhörnchen auf einen andern springen müssen. Doch unser einer ist flüchtig!“ Es zog sein Schwert und versetzte jedem ein paar tüchtige Hiebe in die Brust, dann gieng es hinaus zu den Reitern und sprach „die Arbeit ist getan, ich habe beiden den Garaus gemacht, aber hart ist es hergegangen, sie haben in der Not Bäume ausgerissen und sich gewehrt, doch das hilft alles nichts wenn einer kommt wie ich, der siebene auf einen Streich schlägt.“ „Seid ihr denn nicht verwundet?“ fragten die Reiter. „Das hat gute Wege,“ antwortete der Schneider, „kein Haar haben sie mir gekrümmt.“ Die Reiter wollten ihm keinen Glauben beimessen und ritten in den Wald hinein. Da fanden sie die Riesen in ihrem Blute schwimmend, und rings herum lagen die ausgerissenen Bäume.\n\nDas Schneiderlein verlangte von dem König die versprochene Belohnung, den aber reute sein Versprechen und er sann aufs neue wie er sich den Helden vom Halse schaffen könnte. „Ehe du meine Tochter und das halbe Reich erhältst,“ sprach er zu ihm, „musst du noch eine Heldentat vollbringen. In dem Walde läuft ein Einhorn, das grossen Schaden anrichtet, das musst du erst einfangen.“ „Vor einem Einhorne fürchte ich mich noch weniger als vor zwei Riesen; siebene auf einen Streich, das ist meine Sache.“ Er nahm sich einen Strick und eine Axt mit, gieng hinaus in den Wald, und hiess abermals die, welche ihm zugeordnet waren, aussen warten. Er brauchte nicht lange zu suchen, das Einhorn kam bald daher, und sprang geradezu auf den Schneider los, als wollte es ihn ohne Umstände aufspiessen. „Sachte, sachte,“ sprach er, „so geschwind geht das nicht,“ blieb stehen und wartete bis das Tier ganz nahe war, dann sprang er behendiglich hinter dem Baum. Das Einhorn rannte mit aller Kraft gegen den Baum und spiesste sein Horn so fest in den Stamm, dass es nicht Kraft genug hatte es wieder heraus zu ziehen, und so war es gefangen. „Jetzt hab ich das Vöglein,“ sagte der Schneider, kam hinter dem Baum hervor, legte dem Einhorn den Strick erst um den Hals, dann hieb er mit der Axt das Horn aus dem Baum und als alles in Ordnung war führte er das Tier ab und brachte es dem König.\n\nDer König wollte ihm den verheissenen Lohn noch nicht gewähren, und machte eine dritte Forderung. Der Schneider sollte ihm vor der Hochzeit erst ein Wildschwein fangen, das in dem Wald grossen Schaden tat; die Jäger sollten ihm Beistand leisten. „Gerne,“ sprach der Schneider, „das ist ein Kinderspiel.“ Die Jäger nahm er nicht mit in den Wald, und sie warens wohl zufrieden, denn das Wildschwein hatte sie schon mehrmals so empfangen dass sie keine Lust hatten ihm nachzustellen. Als das Schwein den Schneider erblickte, lief es mit schäumendem Munde und wetzenden Zähnen auf ihn zu, und wollte ihn zur Erde werfen. Der flüchtige Held aber sprang in eine Kapelle, die in der Nähe war, und gleich oben zum Fenster in einem Satze wieder hinaus. Das Schwein war hinter ihm her gelaufen, er aber hüpfte aussen herum und schlug die Türe hinter ihm zu; da war das wütende Tier gefangen, das viel zu schwer und unbehilflich war, um zu dem Fenster hinaus zu springen. Das Schneiderlein rief die Jäger herbei, die mussten den Gefangenen mit eigenen Augen sehen. Der Held aber begab sich zum Könige, der nun, er mochte wollen oder nicht, sein Versprechen halten musste und ihm seine Tochter und das halbe Königreich übergab. Hätte er gewusst dass kein Kriegsheld sondern ein Schneiderlein vor ihm stand, es wäre ihm noch mehr zu Herzen gegangen. Die Hochzeit ward also mit grosser Pracht und kleiner Freude gehalten, und aus einem Schneider ein König gemacht.\n\nNach einiger Zeit hörte die junge Königin in der Nacht wie ihr Gemahl im Traume sprach „Junge, mach mir den Wams und flick mir die Hosen, oder ich will dir die Elle über die Ohren schlagen.“ Da merkte sie in welcher Gasse der junge Herr geboren war, klagte am andern Morgen ihrem Vater ihr Leid und bat er möchte ihr von dem Manne helfen, der nichts anders als ein Schneider wäre. Der König sprach ihr Trost zu und sagte „lass in der nächsten Nacht deine Schlafkammer offen, meine Diener sollen aussen stehen und, wenn er eingeschlafen ist, hineingehen, ihn binden und auf ein Schiff tragen, das ihn in die weite Welt führt.“ Die Frau war damit zufrieden, des Königs Waffenträger aber, der alles mit angehört hatte, war dem jungen Herrn gewogen und hinterbrachte ihm den ganzen Anschlag. „Dem Ding will ich einen Riegel vorschieben,“ sagte das Schneiderlein. Abends legte es sich zu gewöhnlicher Zeit mit seiner Frau zu Bett. Als sie glaubte er sei eingeschlafen, stand sie auf, öffnete die Türe und legte sich wieder. Das Schneiderlein, das sich nur stellte als wenn es schlief, fieng an mit heller Stimme zu rufen „Junge, mach mir den Wams und flick mir die Hosen, oder ich will dir die Elle über die Ohren schlagen! ich habe siebene mit einem Streich getroffen, zwei Riesen getödtet, ein Einhorn fortgeführt, und ein Wildschwein gefangen, und sollte mich vor denen fürchten, die draussen vor der Kammer stehen!“ Als diese den Schneider also sprechen hörten, überkam sie eine grosse Furcht, sie liefen als wenn das wilde Heer hinter ihnen wäre, und keiner wollte sich mehr an ihn wagen. Also war und blieb das Schneiderlein sein Lebtag ein König."

        "text": "Frau Holle.\n\nEs war einmal eine Witwe, die hatte zwei Töchter, davon war die eine schön und fleissig, die andere hässlich und faul. Sie hatte aber die hässliche und faule, weil sie ihre rechte Tochter war, viel lieber, und die andere musste alle Arbeit tun und der Aschenputtel im Hause sein. Das arme Mädchen musste sich täglich auf die grosse Strasse bei einem Brunnen setzen, und musste so viel spinnen, dass ihm das Blut aus den Fingern sprang. Nun trug es sich zu, dass die Spule einmal ganz blutig war, da bückte es sich damit in den Brunnen und wollte sie abwaschen. Sie sprang ihm aber aus der Hand und fiel hinab. Es weinte, lief zur Stiefmutter und erzählte ihr das Unglück. Sie schalt es aber so heftig und war so unbarmherzig, dass sie sprach „hast du die Spule hinunterfallen lassen, so hol sie auch wieder herauf.“ Da gieng das Mädchen zu dem Brunnen zurück und wusste nicht was es anfangen sollte und in seiner Herzensangst sprang es in den Brunnen hinein, um die Spule zu holen. Es verlor die Besinnung, und als es erwachte und wieder zu sich selber kam, war es auf einer schönen Wiese wo die Sonne schien und viel tausend Blumen standen. Auf dieser Wiese gieng es fort und kam zu einem Backofen, der war voller Brot; das Brot aber rief „ach, zieh mich raus, zieh mich raus, sonst verbrenn ich. Ich bin schon längst ausgebacken.“ Da trat es herzu, und holte mit dem Brotschieber alles nach einander heraus. Danach gieng es weiter und kam zu einem Baum, der hieng voll Äpfel, und rief ihm zu „ach schüttel mich, schüttel mich, wir Äpfel sind alle mit einander reif.“ Da schüttelte es den Baum, dass die Äpfel fielen als regneten sie, und schüttelte bis keiner mehr oben war; und als es alle in einen Haufen zusammengelegt hatte, gieng es wieder weiter. Endlich kam es zu einem kleinen Haus, daraus guckte eine alte Frau, weil sie aber so grosse Zähne hatte, ward ihm angst, und es wollte fortlaufen. Die alte Frau aber rief ihm nach „was fürchtest du dich, liebes Kind? bleib bei mir, wenn du alle Arbeit im Hause ordentlich tun willst, so soll dirs gut gehn. Du musst nur Acht geben dass du mein Bett gut machst und es fleissig aufschüttelst, dass die Federn fliegen, dann schneit es in der Welt; ich bin die Frau Holle.“ Weil die Alte ihm so gut zusprach, so fasste sich das Mädchen ein Herz, willigte ein und begab sich in ihren Dienst. Es besorgte auch alles nach ihrer Zufriedenheit, und schüttelte ihr das Bett immer gewaltig auf dass die Federn wie Schneeflocken umher flogen; dafür hatte es auch ein gut Leben bei ihr, kein böses Wort, und alle Tage Gesottenes und Gebratenes. Nun war es eine Zeitlang bei der Frau Holle, da ward es traurig und wusste anfangs selbst nicht was ihm fehlte, endlich merkte es dass es Heimweh war; ob es ihm hier gleich viel tausendmal besser gieng als zu Haus, so hatte es doch ein Verlangen dahin. Endlich sagte es zu ihr „ich habe den Jammer nach Haus kriegt, und wenn es mir auch noch so gut hier unten geht, so kann ich doch nicht länger bleiben, ich muss wieder hinauf zu den Meinigen.“ Die Frau Holle sagte „es gefällt mir, dass du wieder nach Haus verlangst, und weil du mir so treu gedient hast, so will ich dich selbst wieder hinauf bringen.“ Sie nahm es darauf bei der Hand und führte es vor ein grosses Tor. Das Tor ward aufgetan, und wie das Mädchen gerade darunter stand, fiel ein gewaltiger Goldregen, und alles Gold blieb an ihm hängen, so dass es über und über davon bedeckt war. „Das sollst du haben, weil du so fleissig gewesen bist“ sprach die Frau Holle und gab ihm auch die Spule wieder, die ihm in den Brunnen gefallen war. Darauf ward das Tor verschlossen, und das Mädchen befand sich oben auf der Welt, nicht weit von seiner Mutter Haus und als es in den Hof kam, sass der Hahn auf dem Brunnen und rief „kikeriki, unsere goldene Jungfrau ist wieder hie.“\n\nDa gieng es hinein zu seiner Mutter, und weil es so mit Gold bedeckt ankam, ward es von ihr und der Schwester gut aufgenommen.\n\nDas Mädchen erzählte alles, was ihm begegnet war, und als die Mutter hörte wie es zu dem grossen Reichtum gekommen war, wollte sie der andern hässlichen und faulen Tochter gerne dasselbe Glück verschaffen. Sie musste sich an den Brunnen setzen und spinnen; und damit ihre Spule blutig ward, stach sie sich in die Finger und stiess sich die Hand in die Dornhecke. Dann warf sie die Spule in den Brunnen und sprang selber hinein. Sie kam, wie die andere, auf die schöne Wiese und gieng auf demselben Pfade weiter. Als sie zu dem Backofen gelangte, schrie das Brot wieder „ach, zieh mich raus, zieh mich raus, sonst verbrenn ich, ich bin schon längst ausgebacken.“ Die Faule aber antwortete „da hätt ich Lust mich schmutzig zu machen,“ und gieng fort. Bald kam sie zu dem Apfelbaum, der rief „ach, schüttel mich, schüttel mich, wir Äpfel sind alle mit einander reif.“ Sie antwortete aber „du kommst mir recht, es könnte mir einer auf den Kopf fallen,“ und gieng damit weiter. Als sie vor der Frau Holle Haus kam, fürchtete sie sich nicht, weil sie von ihren grossen Zähnen schon gehört hatte, und verdingte sich gleich zu ihr. Am ersten Tag tat sie sich Gewalt an, war fleissig und folgte der Frau Holle, wenn sie ihr etwas sagte, denn sie dachte an das viele Gold, das sie ihr schenken würde; am zweiten Tag aber fieng sie schon an zu faullenzen, am dritten noch mehr, da wollte sie Morgens gar nicht aufstehen. Sie machte auch der Frau Holle das Bett nicht wie sichs gebührte, und schüttelte es nicht, dass die Federn aufflogen. Das ward die Frau Holle bald müde und sagte ihr den Dienst auf. Die Faule war das wohl zufrieden und meinte nun würde der Goldregen kommen; die Frau Holle führte sie auch zu dem Tor, als sie aber darunter stand, ward statt des Goldes ein grosser Kessel voll Pech ausgeschüttet. „Das ist zur Belohnung deiner Dienste“ sagte die Frau Holle und schloss das Tor zu. Da kam die Faule heim, aber sie war ganz mit Pech bedeckt, und der Hahn auf dem Brunnen, als er sie sah, rief „kikeriki,\nunsere schmutzige Jungfrau ist wieder hie.“Das Pech aber blieb fest an ihr hängen und wollte, so lange sie lebte, nicht abgehen."
